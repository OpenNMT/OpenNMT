Madam President , to be quite honest , this is because Mr Galeote has an unexpected and very urgent engagement elsewhere .
As you know , Mr Martens , it is possible for rapporteurs to arrange deputies for themselves .
Madam President , I would ask the House to accept Mr Galeote 's apologies .
His engagement is something which has come up quite unexpectedly .
We would therefore ask that the item be removed from the agenda or postponed .
Madam President , if the PPE Group were really so interested in postponing this report , it would present its reasons to the House .
As we do not know its reasons , my group will vote against the request .
Madam President , I am in favour of it being postponed , provided it comes back on a Friday morning as the last item on the agenda !
( Parliament decided to keep the report on the agenda )
We have the discussion on Tuesday morning on the Commission 's information policy regarding BSE ( mad cow disease ) .
Could you please inform us whether it will be Mr Santer ?
I can tell you straight away , Mrs Green , that in view of the importance of this issue , which we all appreciate , both Mr Santer and Mr Fischler will be present .
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen , I should like to welcome a delegation from the Japanese Diet , who have taken their seats in the Official Gallery .
On behalf of all Members of the House , I sincerely welcome you to the European Parliament , and I hope that our work together will be extremely successful .

Major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances
Madam President , before I begin I should like to say that I come here as the rapporteur on this report at second reading .
I took it over at the beginning of this Parliament , a lot of the work on it having already been done by a colleague of mine , Claude Delcroix .
We owe him a debt of gratitude .
We have in front of us a directive up for a third revision , it having been thought necessary to review it in the light of experience , technical progress and operating knowledge .
We should not underestimate just how important this directive is .
Far too often many of the installations which this directive is designed to safeguard , operate quietly and unobtrusively without people realizing the great dangers that they pose .
The common position before us today is generally one which Parliament would agree with . It does not alter the general structures of the proposal .
In fact it has certainly been improved by the addition of some of Parliament 's amendments from first reading .
But there are some areas where we believe that acceptance of some more of Parliament 's amendments might improve the text further .
We therefore offer the Council and the Commission second reading amendments to make improvements in the following areas .
We feel that seriously weakens the directive and should be improved .
We feel further work should be done in that area .
In addition , there is the issue of land-use planning .
We placed particular emphasis on this at first reading and we do not feel that enough of our concerns have been taken up by the Commission and the Council so far within the proposal .
There are a number of other technical issues with regard to harmonization of certain reporting criteria and harmonization of certain aspects of the inspection of these installations .
However , we recognize that this is the kind of legislation which grows incrementally , as it is now moving on to its third reading .
It is legislation which grows as we learn of the greater dangers that are occurring around us , and which we would expect to see grow , perhaps as a result of future revision in years to come .
We would therefore appeal to the Commission and the Council to examine again this proposal and take on board more of Parliament 's amendments to ensure that we continue to lead the world .
We have been leading the world and are proud to lead the world in chemical plant safety and protecting public health and the safety of our citizens .
We feel that is what should be being done now and into the next century .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we recently celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the Seveso disaster . This major accident occurred in 1976 .
Since 1982 , there has been legislation in the European Union on the major-accident hazards of certain industrial activities . Minor amendments to this legislation were made in 1987 and 1988 .
As the Commission has ascertained , the provisions of this legislation - especially as regards the technical aspects , the prevention and tackling of accidents , and emergency plans - have proved very successful .
Nevertheless , they have not managed to prevent some 130 accidents from occurring since 1982 .
In the past , the legislation has affected some 1866 undertakings .
In our view , the protection of people and the environment in the vicinity of potentially dangerous installations must be improved further .
The top priorities are to prevent major accidents involving dangerous substances and , should such an accident occur , to limit its consequences for people and the environment .
Our group supports this goal fully and absolutely .
However , I have doubts that we are achieving it .
I believe that it is important to bring this directive into line with other legislation on the same subjects .
This includes the definition concerning the IPPC directive .
Also in line with the IPPC directive , requirements for operators to provide information have been introduced .
The rules concerning the provision of information have been brought into line with those contained in the existing directive on free access to information on the environment .
My group is therefore opposed to some of the amendments which have been tabled , which might call this consistency into question .
I regret the fact that they have not been submitted on time .
I questioned the Commission on this matter in committee , but I did not receive a reply .
Parliament and the Council are excluded from this decision : it is a matter for the Commission alone .
I therefore greatly regret the fact that Parliament has not been included in this regard .
What is more , the rigid timescales proposed in the amendments rejected by the Council could hamper industrial activity and production still further , without achieving the desired results .
I think the Commission 's proposal is sound , but there is still room for improvement , and it is now up to Parliament to put forward amendments to consolidate it .
Having heard what the rapporteur has had to say , not just today but over recent months , I can tell you that the Liberals will support all the amendments he has proposed .
I shall not go through them all , particularly on such a hot afternoon , but I would like to mention nuclear and military installations and storage facilities .
It seems inconceivable to me that the second should be covered , but not the first .
Madam President , first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Bowe on his report and to say that I agree with him that we are moving in the right direction .
However , Madam President , bearing in mind our experience in Greece - where not so long ago we nearly had another Seveso at Perama - I do have three things to say .
Mr President , I support Mr Bowe and his report and the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection .
I totally disagree with Mrs Baldi .
It would appear that she is basically a spokesperson for the military and for industry .
Parliament has a duty to support what the Environment Committee is proposing .
It has a duty to increase the safety of citizens facing dangers posed by the concentration of hazardous substances in the atmosphere , particularly in urban areas .
Parliament 's duty should first and foremost be to the citizens , not to industry or the military .
Also , I would support Mr Bowe on public participation . That is vital .
Basically , Ireland is very ill equipped for dealing with major accidents in the chemicals industry .
The authorities have been reckless in allowing the Norwegian multinational , Dinochem , to start construction of a glue manufacturing plant at Marino Point .
14 , 000 people live on the nearby island , and if there were to be a major accident , their only point of exit would be a bridge which is only 300 metres from the new plant .
In such an event the possibility of so many people being marooned is alarming .
There is already a need for EU legislation to make Member States take account of the need for the adequate separation of plants posing major hazards from population centres .
The Irish authorities decided to play with fire when they set out to encourage industrial development by multinational chemicals companies in Ireland without looking at the long-term consequences .
Mr Bowe has said that it is essential that the public should participate and also that there should be proper training .
Most accidents occur as a result of human error . It is extremely important that emphasis be put on public training .
Parliament should support what the Environment Committee is putting forward .
It is our duty to put citizens ' interests first and not the interests of industry or chemicals companies .
People must come first !
If you look at what happened at Bhopal in India , people are still suffering . They have received no compensation .
What has happened to those people ?
I have never really been able to regard whisky as a dangerous chemical .
Perhaps I am a little prejudiced , representing as I do almost all the Scotch whisky in the world .
But I am happy to say there is an exemption for part of the procedural arrangements .
There is nothing more secure than a whisky bond for the reason that it is guarded by the police because of the tax value of the whisky in the bond .
It is a bit like going to Fort Knox to go to visit a whisky bond .
So I am happy that there has been at least part exemption .
Mr President , the Council adopted its common position unanimously , and incorporated a considerable number of amendments from the first reading .
This is extremely good news .
The remaining points need not , in my view , present any insuperable problems for the Commission or the Council .
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the way he has handled this whole issue .
His amendments have always taken a very clear direction , focusing firmly on safety and openness , and it seems likely that the new Seveso Directive will be a clear and easily implemented piece of legislation .
The protection of workers and the public in general is important enough to warrant legislation of the very highest quality .
I know that industrial safety is primarily the responsibility of the firms concerned , but there is still a need for a clear legal framework .
Can the Commission explain why it did not include this amendment ?
Loss of concentration , the gradual decline into lazy habits and becoming inured to dangerous situations are risks that workers face every day .
One final point : there have been complaints that extending the scope of the obligations in the directive will impose too great a burden on industry , out of all proportion to the gains in safety .
I should like to hear what the Commission thinks about this .
Do we know how great this extra burden will be ?
To allow any recurrence of accidents like those at Chernobyl and Seveso would be unthinkable .
This directive has as its specific objective the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances produced and used at industrial installations . It will replace Directive 82 / 501 , also known as the Seveso directive .
Fourteen years on from the introduction of the directive , the wealth of experience acquired in the interim had to be incorporated into the legislation .
This present directive draws on that more recently acquired knowledge and experience to provide a more effective future approach to major accidents involving dangerous substances .
That is a vital element of this new directive , because the exchange of information , the general provision of information and the periodic review of the safety reports will facilitate an ongoing process of adjustment .
In our view , the registering of almost major accidents will provide important information which can further the cause of safety , for the simple reason that almost major accidents are more numerous than those which actually occur .
So there is no doubt that we are dealing here with a valuable proposal which gives the EU 's citizens a guarantee that their safety is being ensured as far as possible .
The changes build on the principles which are already contained in the directive , but a number of important key areas have been extended and strengthened .
We have the same goals in this respect .
I shall now discuss the amendments which have been tabled and indicate the Commission 's position on each of them .
Amendments Nos 2 , 29 , 30 and 32 can also be accepted in part .
It has been pointed out that six of the amendments tabled express concern at the number of exemptions from the directive .
I feel that these are entirely relevant concerns , and the Commission is trying as far as possible to meet them .
The Commission is thus giving priority to activities which are in progress in this area .
Amendment No 15 concerns the exclusion of military establishments , and both the rapporteur and several other speakers referred to this question .
I can appreciate Parliament 's concern , but this matter does not fall within the area of competence of the Community .
Amendments Nos 3 and 18 are aimed at bringing land-fills , i.e. waste disposal sites , within the scope of the directive .
It was also pointed out that seven amendments deal with the need to include so-called ' near misses ' in the directive .
These are already covered by Annex VI of the common position , but a number of these amendments have been accepted because they further improve the protection in this important area .
The most appropriate and effective way of establishing such criteria is through the committee procedure laid down in the existing directive .
This approach has already proved its worth in the production of guidelines in various sectors , including accident analysis , safety reports and safety management systems .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Water , energy , transport and telecommunications markets
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for the second time , Parliament is debating the Commission proposal amending the sectoral directive .
The starting point for this proposal was the first GATT Agreement on Government Procurement , which the European Union signed at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round .
The aim of that agreement is the increased liberalization and expansion of world trade .
The new agreement goes much further than the previous procurement agreement and encompasses contracts which , according to the Commission , will be worth some ECU 350 billion a year .
Parliament very much welcomes this agreement .
However , the Commission itself stresses in its proposal that amendments to Community law are not necessarily essential for the implementation of the agreement by the European Union .
Today , at the end of that debate , Parliament 's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is submitting to the House an almost unanimous recommendation to reject the Commission proposal at first reading .
For over a year now , in a series of discussions with the Commission - but also following a hearing of the business associations concerned - Parliament has been striving to achieve a reasonable compromise .
I am personally grateful to Commissioner Monti for repeatedly stressing the Commission 's readiness - as regards any differences of opinion between Parliament and the Commission - to study Parliament 's arguments concerning the content of the proposal .
We only wish to see new legislation in the problem areas - such as threshold values , which must be adjusted - in which this is urgently necessary .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy reached an agreement with Mr Monti that the Commission would endeavour to withdraw its proposal and submit a new proposal to the Council and Parliament .
We are convinced that this is the only way to ensure that Parliament 's proposals are adequately taken into account in the subsequent discussions .
Mr Monti declared his willingness to support Parliament 's position in this respect , as well as on the essential issues of content .
For procedural reasons , however , he was unable to secure a majority for this position in the Commission .
There are differences of opinion - and a need for discussion - particularly with regard to the so-called ' technical dialogue ' in the case of complex and technically demanding procurement plans .
In our view , this will result in a significant restriction of technological progress , thereby leading to considerable competitive disadvantages for European industry , to which the directive applies .
We take the view that the procedure adopted hitherto in this respect has proved its worth .
Transposition of the GPA is of far-reaching importance for the competitive position of European industry .
This is particularly true of the high-tech areas of the sectoral directive , where in order to secure its future as a strong global player , the European Community must remain competitive when markets are opened up .
In our opinion , what is important is to maintain strict reciprocity , as called for by Parliament a few months ago in its resolution on the G7 conference .
To ensure the appropriate transparency , the GPA should therefore be transposed through a supplementary directive which will contain the exceptions and special arrangements and will refer to the existing EU directives on public tendering .
We are trusting in the good sense of the Commission as a collegiate body , as well as in the promises that Mr Monti has given us .
The effects of implementing the proposals contained in this Commission document will be immense .
Every company which deals with contracting entities in any of the utilities sectors will have to adjust its working practices to conform with the rules that we impose upon them .
Even though this is an internal directive , it cannot be taken in isolation , just as the EU cannot be taken in isolation .
The fact that these proposals are being introduced to eliminate disadvantages created by the implementation of the GPA demonstrates how we are all intertwined .
So to evaluate these proposals as a whole , we should look at what we are competing against , to see what practice , or what common practice there is in the market-place .
When we look at our major rivals - firstly Japan - the Japanese are making no attempt to draw up similar legislation to that put forward by the Commission .
More than two years ago they promised to do this , yet there has been no action .
They have had rulings in their courts that no foreign legislation can take precedent over domestic legislation , which legitimizes their protectionist trade regime .
Now with the Helms-Burton Bill , we even have the American Government taking non-American companies to court over trading with Cuba .
We do not condone this ; we call on the Commission to actively pursue these matters and insist on the full implementation of all agreements signed at international level .
This is very important because taxpayers ' money is involved here .
We also need to ensure that , whatever measures are put in place , our businesses will be left as competitive as possible , both domestically and in terms of overseas competition .
The problem is that at the moment we simply do not know what the right practices are .
Representatives of all sectors of industry have indicated , at a public hearing , that they see huge problems with the Commission proposals .
Unlike the Commission they did not consider these proposals as benefits but burdens , they were unanimous in their opposition .
We have asked the Commission on more than one occasion to supply information on the practical effects of their proposals , they have not so done .
Let us have justifications . Let us consult on this .
The Union pays out a fortune on studies every year . If ever there was a clear case for a study there is a case for one on public procurement .
We have heard much from the Commission on the distortions in the internal market caused by bringing some sectors into the scope of the directive and leaving others out .
That is one question .
Another is that by changing the status of sectors , do we not distort the existing market ?
Does the Commission expect companies to run two systems , one for internal transactions and one for external , thereby increasing costs ?
We have been told the Commission has a legal obligation to press ahead with this legislation .
We do not know whether this is true .
There is no proof that this has been put before the committee despite repeated requests on our behalf .
We in the Parliament need to be cautious .
We are dealing with matters which may be simple on paper yet have important implications for jobs .
What we need is time .
We have time to get this directive right because it does not have to be implemented until 1998 .
The Commission knows what we want and we can act fairly and effectively and as quickly as possible when we get that proposal .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our group will be following the advice of Mr Langen , rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy .
Indeed , the Union for Europe Group cannot accept the manner in which the Commission has interpreted the content of the GATT agreements .
What is fundamentally at issue here ?
The transposition of the GPA is vitally important to the competitiveness of the European economy .
This observation applies in particular to the high-tech areas of the directive on specific sectors .
In this context , the European Community has a duty - especially when it opens up its markets - to secure its economic future by maintaining its status as a strong and competitive global player .
Since , with the system for which it provides , the proposal under discussion exceeds the scope of the GPA , it must be resolutely rejected .
This was the conclusion of the public hearing of European companies and businesses held by Parliament on 31 October 1995 .
However , the public market in the United States accounts for only a fraction of the market as a whole .
Mr Langen therefore has our support with regard to this matter .
Mr Monti will have to go back to the drawing-board .
There is , however , every reason to adopt a cautious approach .
The Green Group as well fully supports Mr Langen 's conclusion that the Commission should submit a fresh proposal to Parliament .
It would be appropriate for Commissioner Monti to explain briefly , for example during this debate , on what basis the Commission intends to draw up a fresh proposal .
We are dealing here with two different legal orders : the international agreement on the one hand and the Community directives on the same subject on the other .
In the natural way of things the international agreement regulates relations between the Member States of the European Union and third countries .
The Community directives cover the rules applicable in the Member States .
These directives cannot change the international order ; nor can they confer on suppliers and contractors from outside the European Union rights which operate to the disadvantage of suppliers and contractors in the Member States .
What else should we expect them to say ?
Mr President , it is well-known that there are many other special problems in the public works and procurement sector .
Corruption is very deeply rooted .
These things are happening all over Europe .
In Belgium a general committed suicide some time ago in connection with a similar circumstance .
The Commission 's desire to tighten up the system is laudable .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Langen , and recalling the context in which we are operating .
Consequently , the GPA entered into force in the Community on 1 January 1996 , as provided for in its Article XXIV .
Its implementation in the Community does not in itself require any transposition .
It should be made clear that these amendments do not represent a unilateral openingup of Community contracts to third-country businesses .
The GPA governs the relations between the Community and third countries , so the rights of third-country businesses to participate in Community contracts are laid down and circumscribed by the GPA itself .
The purpose of the Commission 's proposal is to guarantee Community businesses equal treatment to that given to businesses from third countries .
It may be , for the reasons mentioned by Mr Katiforis , that not all of these points emerged at the hearings .
As things stand , Community businesses do not enjoy these rights and advantages ; the negative consequences for them are obvious and serious .
Clearly , however , the directive does need to be amended as soon as possible , so as to restore without delay a level playing field for third-country businesses and Community firms .
These are the main reasons why the Commission is convinced of the need to amend the directive .
Other concerns have emerged in the course of discussion .
I can therefore confirm that the Commission intends to present an amended proposal based on the suggestions made in the committee .
In conclusion , I can summarize my position by saying that I intend to present an amended proposal for a directive , taking account of the concerns expressed in the course of the debate in committee .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Wine products
Accordingly , this amendment was included in the common position established by the Council on 29 April 1996 in a reworded form .
Parliament 's arguments were therefore accepted .
This change is important , since the wording suggested that each Member State could draw up its own legislation governing oenological practices and processes .
Consequently , there could have been technical deterioration and distortions , since not all Member States have a wine-making tradition .
The other amendments essentially concern the Italian version of Article 2 ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) of Regulation ( EEC ) No 1601 / 91 , synonyms being added for some descriptions and indications .
These amendments should therefore be agreed to as they stand .
With regard to the definition of ' Kalte Ente ' , deletion of the reference to the taste of lemon is a response to what is a fact of life on the market and for the firms concerned .
This amendment should therefore be agreed to as it stands .
It is therefore important to take this opportunity to say that the consumption of wine must be encouraged in all the Member States .
I should therefore like to pay tribute to our rapporteur , Mr Martin , for securing such a successful outcome for this draft regulation .
In our Committee on Agriculture it is always Mr Philippe Martin who deals with this subject and that is because he is the leading authority on the matter .
Once again he has demonstrated that authority which is why his recommendations and proposals , already approved by us in the Committee on Agriculture , were approved in full by the Council .
That is why it is not difficult for us to support this joint position given that it is full of common sense and good reason .
I think that wine-based cocktails and drinks aromatized with wine products are now being recognised as traditional in certain markets and for certain consumers .
I think that for this reason this debate is positive since we are speaking about products which guarantee the use of wine and enhance it through a number of derived products .
This is very important as long as the rules of the game are clear in terms of quality and discipline .
I should like to conclude by echoing what Mrs Lulling said .
Two years ago there was a respective proposal by the Commission .
In the meantime the European Parliament , 18 months ago , approved a compromise proposal , a very interesting opinion , but the whole matter has been forgotten .
I would like to ask the Commissioner : in which draw is the wine COM ?
I think it would be good for us to discuss this .
I am thinking in particular of ' Fernet Branca ' .
Mr President , I also wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr Martin , for his report .
Nevertheless , at second reading of this proposal , I should like to make one or two critical comments .
We are discussing aromatized wines , wine-based drinks and wine-product cocktails .
All these terms include the word ' wine ' .
In accordance with all current foodstuffs legislation in Europe , wine is a drink that is produced from the fermentation of fresh grapes .
I believe that we must respond to this situation with clear rules governing descriptions .
When consumers purchase and consume this product , they must be able to recognize clearly that it is a composite drink .
They must be able to trust in the fact that they are not being offered a counterfeit .
I agree with the opinion of previous speakers that we must adopt a common organization of the European wine market and find a joint solution as soon as possible .
I believe that this will make an important contribution to ensuring the confidence of European wine producers and consumers , who have a right to be offered quality products .
Mr President , Sweden is not a wine-producing country but we in Sweden are consumers of the wines and other drinks concerned in this report .
The report deals with definitions , descriptions and presentations of aromatised wines .
The main theme of the report is that traditional methods and traditional products , as defined in the respective Member States , should be respected .
They are not the same in northern Europe as in southern Europe .
We hope that these rules will continue to apply in the future .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , when we discussed the proposal now before the House at first reading , I was able - as you will remember - to accept all the amendments that were tabled .
You will no doubt be aware that they have all been incorporated into the common position established by the Council on 29 April 1996 .
I am pleased to be able to say that we are also in agreement at second reading .
The common position contains only a few new features and makes only a small number of changes , principally of wording .
Parliament was informed of the Commission 's approval of the common position on 23 May 1996 .
I welcome the fact that the unchanged recommendation of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , and its rapporteur , Mr Martin , is now before us for second reading .
This should enable the Council to adopt the proposal without delay .
In conclusion , I wish to thank Mr Martin and the Committee on Agriculture for their work , which has made it possible to achieve a rapid solution .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Groundhandling at airports
It is not just because of my inconvenience , but many people were interested in this particular debate and have made arrangements to be here tomorrow .
It seems to me very unprofessional of Parliament to make changes to the agenda at the last minute when people do not know and cannot change their arrangements .
Having said that , I am extremely disappointed , as rapporteur , at having to recommend to Parliament rejection of this common position .
I and members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism wanted to be positive about this draft directive .
We wanted to improve the service given at airports for passengers , for the airlines , for everybody concerned with airports .
We wanted to improve choice . We are not against liberalization .
What we wanted was more choice , but choice which maintained safety and security standards for passengers .
None of the committee or Parliament favoured complete deregulation with a free-for-all .
That is why we felt that the Commission draft directive on groundhandling was indeed very poor . We felt it was incomplete .
We felt it had not evolved from discussion with the interested parties .
In fact , there had been negligible discussion with the interested parties , as I found when I started to meet them as rapporteur .
I would like to compliment the members of the Transport Committee who worked on this report .
They worked hard to change that draft directive ; to change it into something that was acceptable and something that would work .
We spent a lot of time doing that .
As rapporteur I was very proud of the result .
The amended draft directive was then accepted by all the parties : the airlines , the airports , the independent groundhandlers , the trade unions .
Everyone felt that the amended directive was then acceptable .
So what happened with the Council ?
The Council then used an approach which I am afraid is becoming all too common .
There was no discussion .
Certainly , although this is a cooperation procedure , the Council would not even agree to informal talks with Parliament .
And so what have we got ?
Because of this we have a common position that is totally unacceptable . It is totally unacceptable to everyone , even to Mr Jarzembowski , who seems to have done a U-turn on this at the last moment !
Let me point out to you , Mr Jarzembowski , as well as everyone else , that the independent groundhandlers find it unacceptable .
They want rejection .
They do not want a ' Big Bang ' change and they do not want existing contracts to be dropped , but that is what it says in the common position .
The airlines are not happy .
They want rejection .
Even in the United Kingdom , to my amazement , British Airways and British Midland both feel that this common position should be rejected and have asked Members to do that .
I am afraid that the airports , however , are worried about a much tougher stance by the Commission if this is rejected .
Finally regarding the workforce . The workforce is extremely unhappy with the common position .
It too feels that Parliament ought to reject it . The user committee has been emasculated and the social safeguards that Parliament felt it very important to insert in the draft directive have been mostly ignored .
Let me say also that the customers are not happy .
I believe that , if they knew about the compromise on safety and security , the customers would be extremely unhappy indeed .
It is entering into comitology and that is something that we certainly cannot allow .
I urge Parliament to reject this common position .
Mr President , as the rapporteur said , this issue of groundhandling has been a long-running saga and , in fact , was initiated by the airlines themselves .
When the committee of experts reported back it could only provide a majority report . There was not unanimity in their particular report .
But we believe that where there is liberalization there are certain matters that have to be taken into account .
Parliament recognized these problems at the first reading and amended the proposal accordingly , particularly in the area of social protection .
However , the Council chose to ignore Parliament 's view and agreed a common position that is unacceptable and something of a dog 's breakfast .
It is very difficult to find anybody who actually agrees or likes this particular common position with the exception of the group opposite .
So what have we got with this common position ?
So one has to pose the question in those circumstances : if there are so many people who do not like this particular groundhandling common position , why should we as a party vote for it .
It appears to my group that only one course of action is open and that is rejection .
These are words , I believe , that should be placed at the bottom of the Council 's common position .
My group supports the recommendation for rejection that has been put forward by the Committee on Transport and Tourism through its rapporteur .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , I think you need to have a word with your British Labour colleagues on this occasion .
Mr Simpson , Mr Seal , I cannot understand you at all !
Naturally , I encountered the same problems : neither the airports nor the airlines were very happy with the proposal .
They all said , however , that some kind of regulation is better than none .
I can only say , therefore , that you are being unrealistic !
As Christian Democrats , we are in favour of the liberalization of groundhandling services .
Commissioner , perhaps you could give your Labour colleagues an individual tutorial on this matter !
Sensible liberalization , therefore , is what we must strive to achieve .
There is a great deal at stake in this proposal for a directive on groundhandling .
We are faced with a simple choice .
Our first option is to adopt a principled stance and register Parliament 's dissatisfaction by rejecting the common position .
We must weigh up the implications of such action .
If there is not unanimity in the Council , we shall have to start the entire process all over again - something which would take months , if not years .
There would then be a legal vacuum .
As you know , ladies and gentlemen , nature abhors a vacuum .
There would therefore be countless long and complex legal disputes .
Let us also not forget that if a directive is not adopted , the Commission will be at total liberty to decide and lay down rules pursuant to Article 90 ( 3 ) of the Treaty .
We must consider all the implications of this .
Our second option is to amend the common position .
In doing so , Parliament will display an attitude of constructive criticism , by defending the essential points that are inadequately taken into account in the common position .
Personally , I prefer the second option .
I shall therefore vote against rejection of the common position and in favour of the amendments which seek to ensure increased safety , improved quality of services and the maintenance of social protection .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate the Commission .
A considerable number of amendments have been tabled , a fact which speaks for itself .
It also means that when the committee voted by a majority of one to reject the common position , it was already fighting a lost cause .
I think this is an extremely dangerous situation for the dignity and position of the House .
My group will not on any account support the rejection of the common position , nor did it do so in the committee .
The aim of this directive is to deregulate the sector in order to open it up to free competition .
Certain US companies - chiefly motivated by financial considerations - are stepping up pressure in all the Community 's institutions for the adoption of this directive .
What a contempt for public aspirations and the most fundamental rules of democracy ! This is the hidden side of all the talk about a social Europe !
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Seal 's report illustrates once again the interest that Parliament takes in transport issues .
This interest was confirmed by the vote at the last meeting of the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
All the political groups mobilized their troops - both Members and officials - in an extraordinary case of lobbying .
Now , the ARE Group has discussed this report and reached the following conclusions .
Faced with this impossible situation , we have no option but to announce our rejection of the common position .
Nevertheless , we await with interest the political developments which may occur between now and voting time .
Rejecting the common position will only prolong this undesirable state of affairs .
The common position has a number of shortcomings , not least of which is the possibility that the airlines might be completely excluded from the groundhandling market .
In short , this is a cautious step in the right direction .
By adopting a number of amendments , we can improve the common position further still , and only those who do not want to see the situation change could have any reason to reject it .
Mr President , the common position established by the Council on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports is likely not to be approved .
Parliament did in fact attempt to improve the proposal for a directive by submitting various amendments , almost all of which were ignored by the Council .
Since the common position is not unacceptable in its entirety , it requires further amendment , and certain amendments must be accepted ; Parliament must therefore express its views on some of these aspects in plenary sitting .
Moreover , there are a number of negative aspects arising in connection with the procedure .
The fact that the Council was not even prepared to discuss informally the improvements overwhelmingly called for by Parliament indicates a disrespect for this House .
This is an outcome which the European Parliament can only note powerlessly .
In comparison with the original inadequate Commission proposal , a number of changes and improvements have been made , but important elements are missing .
Parliament 's proposals for social measures , as well as those geared more towards making the measures workable , have been almost completely ignored .
Airports must thus be able to control the technical and operational management of infrastructure .
Finally , we are calling for workers ' organizations to be supported in their defence of social protection and the criteria for participation in the event of structural change .
These are realities which the PSE Group cannot accept .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , competition is a key element of our social market economy .
Who would not be in favour of the liberalization of competition ?
Who would be against curbing any domination of the market ?
However , the details of what is acceptable in principle must also be correct .
The conditions of competition must be fair .
Dumping in terms of prices or conditions is unacceptable .
The criteria for suppliers and their services must be quite clearly defined .
The Council 's common position incorporates only some of Parliament 's proposals . These include express recognition of the fact that the Member States must guarantee a high level of social protection .
Employees ' rights with regard to training and occupational safety must be taken into account .
The proposal to restrict self-handling for reasons of space and capacity is also included .
However , the necessary balance in the safeguarding of the interests of users - passengers and airport employees - is absent from the common position .
Further points must also be incorporated into the common position .
Firstly , in any restructuring process , priority must be given to safeguarding existing jobs and guaranteeing the social protection of employees .
Secondly , with a view to ensuring quality - a key element of industrial productivity in Europe - a higher level of training , conforming to the ISO 9000 standard , should be aimed at .
It is in the interests of passengers that no mistakes are made in groundhandling , that precision is not the exception but the rule .
A qualified groundhandler makes an essential contribution to maintaining the highest standards of safety .
Thirdly , the concept of self-handler must be clearly defined .
If parent and subsidiary companies simply provide groundhandling services for each other , then we must seriously ask ourselves whether competition is genuinely being ensured !
Fourthly , the planned user committee must include representatives of travel organizations and airport employees , with a view to protecting workers ' interests .
In order to ensure the committee 's neutrality , its chairman must be independent of the airport and its users .
I call on the Commission to support these views .
If it backs us in the vote on these and other amendments tomorrow , there will no longer be any argument for rejecting the Council 's common position .
Our positions have moved closer together .
Now the Commission must take the decisive step !
The argument that we should accept this because it is less bad than the present situation is ludicrous .
Rather than doing that , we would all be better off sitting on the beach back in our countries , I think , bearing in mind the time of year .
Mr President , if the common position is adopted in this form , it will lead to serious discrimination against airlines at their home airport .
From the economic point of view , there is no real justification for airport managing bodies to receive better treatment than the airlines which use the airport in question as their home base .
The airlines possess the necessary facilities and qualified staff at their home airport .
The destruction of current and future jobs within airlines can hardly be the Council 's intention .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have before the House today a report which has been causing us a great deal of concern for several months .
I should therefore like to reiterate that our main objective is - and must continue to be - to ensure that airports remain as independent economic bodies .
At both readings , therefore , we have attempted to introduce stringent requirements for self-handlers .
This is the only way to preserve the investment power of airports and to protect groundhandling services from market dominance by home airlines .
I also believe that it is imperative for employees to be represented in the user committee .
The thinking of management and labour must undoubtedly be incorporated into such important decisions .
The harmonization of training and safety standards will be to everyone 's benefit : airlines , passengers and employees .
It is very rare that a common position is rejected by the committee concerned .
However , we have been confirmed in our decision by the numerous comments of all the interested parties .
It must be clear to everyone : the Council and the Commission have failed to achieve a balanced compromise between the interests of airlines , airports and employees .
If the Commissioner is unable to assure us today that he supports our amendments , this House will have only one course of action : rejection of the common position !
Mr President , I welcome the Commission proposal which attempts to introduce a degree of liberalization and competition in groundhandling services in airports from 1998 .
Regrettably , the common position dilutes the whole basis of the Commission proposal , seriously delaying the introduction of liberalization and competition .
Why should British travellers not be allowed the same standard of service when travelling in France , Germany , Italy , Greece and Spain as is currently available in the UK ?
I want the best for Europe 's travellers , an excellent service at a reasonable price .
Currently , travellers have poor service at a high cost .
We must give the travellers choice and introduce competition .
I want each and every one of us to stand up and be counted and to vote for competition , choice and lower prices .
Mr President , I support the proposal of the Committee on Transport for rejection of the common position and I commend Mr Seal for recommending that .
The Council 's common position appears unable to resolve any of the problems created in the European airport industry by the whole air transport liberalization policy .
As it spreads to Europe 's airports this policy is assuming even more dangerous proportions .
The Council has provocatively disregarded the European Parliament 's amendments .
It has ignored the consequences for service quality and , most importantly , the consequences for the safety of groundhandling services .
It has ignored the social consequences and the proposals for worker representation on the user committee .
Lastly , it has ignored the special interests of airlines which account individually for more than 25 % of the traffic at an airport and also the special factors affecting island airports .
In the circumstances , I think that the only thing that the European Parliament can do is to support rejection of the common position .
While I , like Miss McIntosh , welcome increased competition in principle , the proposals currently being put forward by Council are badly thought out and ill-considered .
They would mean thousands of job losses throughout Europe in aircraft refuelling , servicing , cleaning , passenger handling and baggage registration .
They would also lead to a serious deterioration in safety standards , a matter which we must all be very concerned about .
The Council 's suggestions have been rejected by everybody directly involved in the industry - in particular by the airlines and the trade unions - and this must tell us something .
I really regret the way in which the Council has refused to discuss the matter properly with Parliament .
It has refused to take up any of our suggestions to safeguard jobs and ensure safety standards are improved .
The Council has even declined to discuss the matter on an informal basis with the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
I am sure that Mr Seal and his colleagues have noted this position .
I will be urging Members to vote against the Council 's common position and I hope that we succeed in getting the required number of votes .
The liberalisation of postal services is one example , groundhandling services at airports another .
This is clearly not the case , which is particularly regrettable .
The Commission 's attempt to create greater competition at Union airports is a good and commendable one .
If more parties are active in the market competition will increase and prices will fall .
Airlines and ultimately passengers will benefit .
In the long term those companies which are exposed to competition will also benefit , as they will be compelled to develop and improve their activities .
It is my opinion nevertheless that , by responding positively to the Council 's common position , we must demonstrate our willingness to carry out the Commission 's intentions .
I believe that a gradual liberalisation in the manner proposed would be extremely positive .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to say first of all that the common position of the Council is clearly better than the Commission proposal .
The Council has improved on the Commission 's positions and recommendations , and I must also point out that a number of provisions approved by the European Parliament at the first reading have been accepted by it .
However , I must ask this question : if the common position is rejected , what will the situation be afterwards ?
That appears to be something that Members on the other side have not thought about , perhaps because they feel that in the end the common position will not be rejected .
I say this because if the common position is rejected , no one can be sure that the Commission will want to bother with it again or that the Council will want to re-examine it .
On that basis I think that we should support the common position as it has come to us , after amending it as best we can .
That is what I wanted to say , and I think that we should concentrate on getting adoption for those amendments which genuinely improve the common position .
Having the Commissioner as our helper and ally will greatly assist the achievement of that .
Mr President , I see that a considerable number of amendments have been tabled by various groups , including those who are in favour of rejecting the common position .
In deciding on whether or not to vote for rejection , a good number of Members will undoubtedly be swayed by the Commission 's position on these amendments .
I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether we can have the Commission 's position on the amendments in writing before the vote .
Until last Thursday this debate was scheduled for tomorrow .
Like several Members of this House , I consequently accepted important public engagements .
The procedures of this House , however , apparently mean that important business can be changed at very short notice .
In order to be able to attend this important debate on groundhandling , therefore , I had to cancel my engagements last Friday .
I consider it important that the relevant Commissioner with a portfolio is in this House to respond on the business for which he or she is responsible .
That is why I had to cancel .
To say that I was infuriated and embarrassed by having to commit such a discourtesy to the very large number of people I had to let down is to make an understatement .
I regret that .
I like to be in agreement with the committee as frequently as I can and I certainly understand the reasons for the view of the committee .
In addition , under specific circumstances , exemptions can be granted by the Member State under the supervision of the Commission .
The reason offered by Mr Seal and Mr Simpson and their colleagues for rejecting the common position refers to the dissatisfaction of the different stakeholders .
I understand their view , since change will always provoke opposition from interests seeking to defend their established position whether they are representatives of employees or in some cases airlines or , in some cases , airports or suppliers .
Indeed , if I were the teacher referred to in a speech by Mr Simpson I would have to take account of two factors when marking the work .
First of all , the need to adhere to the competition rules of the Community and secondly , the diversity of interests involved in groundhandling .
Second , the Commission can accept , in principle , subject to some redrafting , Nos 7 , 11 , 15 , 17 , 20 , 21 , 30 , 33 and 36 .
That concludes the debate .
I will ensure that the remarks that you made on the timing of business are drawn to the attention of the Conference of Presidents .
Mr President , I am pleased that you made your last comment .
I entirely support the criticisms by the Commissioner , and I think that what happened was extremely unfortunate , particularly for those trying to follow our debates .
I also did not hear about it until Friday , since no one took the trouble to inform the chairman of the committee responsible .
I asked the secretariat on Friday to telephone as many people as possible to warn them not to come tomorrow .
I hope you will look into this , Mr President , and let us know what you decide .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow .
Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Hundreds of their relatives in Belgium and the Netherlands are now mourning their loss .
I am sure the House will join you in expressing sympathy and condolences , Mr Cornelissen .
Madam President , I have a question concerning yesterday 's order of business which was approved when the agenda was finally adopted .
My question is this : how can a report - in this case the report on groundhandling services - be brought forward by a day ?
This makes a complete nonsense of the effort we have all been making to ensure that our sittings are open and members of the public can participate .
I take note of your comments , but this was a decision taken by the Conference of Presidents and confirmed by Parliament .
Are there any other comments ?
Madam President , I have to beg your indulgence for the error of my ways , since I failed to sign the attendance register yesterday .
It is my own fault , but I was hoping that you could perhaps vouch for the fact that I was present , thereby correcting my mistake .
In any event , I have to apologize , since it is my own fault .
( Parliament approved the Minutes )
Decision on urgency
Madam President , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture , I would ask all colleagues to vote in favour of this urgent procedure .
This measure is basically intended to rectify a situation which has been worsening progressively of late .
In my report on agricultural prices , I proposed a 10 % reduction in setaside , which seemed at the time to diverge significantly from the Commission 's proposal .
Now the Commission is sensibly proposing 5 % , and that is what farmers are now expecting .
But we must vote on the Gillis report this week , because the Council meeting early next week , on 22 and 23 July , will need to ratify our decision .
I therefore strongly urge that this report should be adopted during this part-session .
Is there anyone wishing to speak against ?
There is not .
( Parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
Free movement of persons
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
It is a fact that the history of these three proposals goes back a long way .
The old European Community Treaty already included provisions for the creation of a common internal market in Europe .
I wish to make it very clear , at the outset , that we welcome these proposals from the Commission and support the action that it is taking on this issue .
The other two proposals concern the elimination of controls on persons , and freedom of movement for thirdcountry nationals who are lawfully in the territory of the European Union .
We are therefore entitled to effective involvement in the decision on workers ' freedom to travel and the exercise of their right of establishment and right to provide services .
I should like to make one final comment on my report . A number of amendments have been tabled with a view to having freedom of movement for third-country nationals included in my report as well .
For that reason alone , the report cannot be extended to cover third-country nationals .
For purely legal reasons , the issue cannot be dealt with in this directive , but will have to be addressed by the other two directives .
These reports arise directly from the Treaty of Rome which sets out very early a commitment to the free movement of goods , services , capital and people .
Unfortunately in the European Union , while the first three flow freely , there has been much more resistance to the free movement of people .
Then , on the very eve of the European Court taking action against the Commission , the new Commission and the new Commissioner , Mr Monti , brought forward these proposals .
The current British Government can , of course , be changed and that is something that may happen in the future .
But more importantly , in terms of the accompanying measures , the external frontiers directive is linked to the British / Spanish dispute over Gibraltar .
Despite the clear legal position it is also very obvious that there is no easy solution to this problem .
When the government and opposition of both Spain and the United Kingdom are so committed to their current position it is not obvious that the external frontiers directive will come into operation early .
There are similar problems with the Dublin Convention .
The more the Commission 's and Parliament 's proposals vary from these clear principles the more difficulty the Socialist Group will have in supporting them .
Yes , of course we agree that there are other measures that will have to be taken in order for these proposals to operate , but they should flow from an agreement and not precede it .
I also agree with Mr Lehne on the draft joint action proposal that has come forward in the last few days .
This has clearly complicated matters and perhaps we need to take all three reports back to committee to see how the new proposal on the draft joint action programme impinges upon them .
The people of Europe have a right to expect substantial progress in this area .
The Commission has not given it to us in the clearest possible way .
We look to the Commission and the Council to proceed , and the Socialist Group - and I hope Parliament - will vote accordingly .
I have already established for my report that the Commission proposal will not , in effect , mean any significant change in the situation on the ground .
My report is based on one of three Commission proposals referred to the committee , which were drawn up with a view to fulfilling the obligations imposed by Article 7a of the EC Treaty .
I would remind you that this is 1996 , and it is only now that the House is discussing these three Commission proposals for fulfilling the obligations to which I have referred .
Although it has taken more than three and a half years to bring practical proposals from the Commission before the House , we are grateful that we now have them .
A gap in the overall concept of the internal market will also mean a loss of confidence among the great majority of European citizens .
Sometimes , however , I cannot help feeling that some of the institutions involved in creating the internal market fail to realize the full weight of their responsibility .
The approach of the Commission and Council to completing the provisions for the free movement of persons indicates how important it is that the European Parliament should be more closely involved in the legislative process .
I can only hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will bring Parliament all that it seeks in this respect .
Who else but ourselves - the democratically elected representatives of the peoples of Europe - can bring the necessary energy to bear in looking after citizens ' interests ?
Clearly , the Commission cannot do without these accompanying measures if it is to have the support of the Member States , but in my view the two sets of issues should be considered separately .
Madam President , the proposals of the Commission in this area are to be welcomed .
Article 48 of the Treaty of Rome laid down a fundamental right for free movement of its citizens .
This was extended to free movement of persons and the Court of Justice has , in its case-law , extended the rights to free movement .
I also want to support the Linzer report , giving rights to third country nationals to travel in the Community .
It has a humane face to it in that it will permit visits to families for weddings , funerals and illnesses .
It also enhances the cultural links in the European Union .
Many people want to come to Europe to see our cultural heritage and this I believe is an important part of our economy and also our links with the rest of the world .
There are no problems for the Member States because this does not impact on employment or on social benefits .
That is made quite clear in the text and therefore there should be no concerns for Member States .
Madam President , like other Members I welcome the Commission 's three proposals to make a reality out of free movement .
I see them as a genuine and realistic attempt to achieve long-held and cherished objectives of the European Community .
I am speaking specifically on the Linzer report on the right of third country nationals to travel .
The object of this proposal is to harmonize national provisions concerning the right of third country nationals to travel and remain within the territory of the Union .
For example , in my own country Pakistani and Indian citizens often prefer , for reasons of relations at home , to keep their Pakistani or Indian nationality .
They will be living in the UK all their lives , yet they have to apply for visas to travel to some Member States of the European Union .
This situation would be resolved by the Commission proposal , and they would be able to move across frontiers freely in the same conditions as other citizens of the European Union .
As Ms Oddy has said , this proposal would not involve the right to work or other rights of establishment . It is simply a right to travel .
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights has two concerns .
The Council 's recent initiative complicates the matter somewhat .
Our committee has called on the Council and the Commission to adopt the necessary measures to eliminate these obstacles .
Finally , the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment insisted that the implementation of these provisions be accompanied by an extensive information campaign .
At present , the Commission is already carrying out an information campaign on the single market .
It is essential for our citizens to know that these obstacles are being removed - and this requires more than just the publication of this information in the Official Journal .
There is a need for all citizens to be made aware of these effective measures .
Thus I believe that all the reservations and - let us be frank - the excuses being put forward about the question of accompanying measures should be cast aside .
In this context , I too think that the Irish presidency 's joint action programme should be scrutinized by Parliament 's Committees on Civil Liberties and Legal Affairs .
Our group will not object if a proposal is made to refer this matter back to committee .
But , I repeat , Europe cannot take shape without free movement of persons .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , when it comes to people , freedom of movement in the European Union is a complicated business .
Only people may not move as freely in the European Union as we would all have wished .
And what were we celebrating ?
Was it the fact that anyone may now take any product , service or capital holding and move freely with it in the Europe of Fifteen ?
Yes , that was part of it .
So why has this right not yet been implemented ?
We have heard all kinds of arguments this morning for curtailing this individual liberty .
Why are the governments mistrustful ?
Such groups undoubtedly pose real problems , but they cannot justify the continued restriction of freedom of movement .
It is high time that we made progress - by creating a confidence offensive .
In my view , this is something that we cannot accept .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the actual date by which freedom of movement in Europe ought to have been made a reality was 1 January 1993 .
But we are a long way from that .
I am not saying that the failure so far to achieve freedom of movement is a breach of the Treaty , but it goes against the intention to which all fifteen Member States put their signature .
They should be able to travel freely in Europe and to see , as citizens , what they make of this European Union that we have entered into .
That has not happened .
And I am not saying that it is the Council , as such , which has prevented it from happening - we must cultivate the habit of taking a rather more critical look at things .
There are certain Member States that are not fulfilling their obligations under the Treaty .
It is only a minority of them which are in this position , and the arguments which they employ do not stand up .
They say that freedom of movement cannot be created just like that , because the internal frontiers have played an important role in combatting crime , for example .
That is a completely anachronistic position to adopt , ladies and gentlemen .
It is an untenable position nowadays for any expert on the subject .
It is quite ridiculous to claim that crime cannot be effectively combatted without frontier controls .
If that were the case - if frontier controls were really necessary for combatting crime - we should have to reintroduce them between Bavaria and Hesse , for example .
Such a thing is unthinkable .
Nowadays , criminal activity needs to be tackled using quite different instruments - Interpol , for example , and the data bases that are to be installed there .
That is the modern way to combat crime - and , amazingly , its implementation is being delayed by precisely the same countries that are denying us freedom of movement on the scale sought by the Treaties .
One of the catchphrases is ' accompanying measures ' .
It is true that the Council still has some homework to do before freedom of movement can become a reality .
It is true that frontier controls cannot simply be abolished without putting some alternative options in place .
The external frontiers must be secured .
This means that the country which allows a person to enter across its external frontier also becomes responsible for that person 's freedom of movement in the Union as a whole .
There is really no other concept of freedom of movement .
I do not intend , at this point , to discuss institutional developments , but it is very clear indeed that the first thing we need to know now is what the Council is actually seeking .
That is why I am convinced that we cannot come to any conclusion until the Council supplies us with some information as regards what it is really up to with its new joint action .
One could therefore be forgiven for wondering if these amendments are simply demagogic .
The adoption of these proposals for directives requires unanimity in the Council .
And certain Member States , for a variety of reasons , are not prepared to call into question these accompanying measures , which fall under the third pillar .
Possession of an identity card or travel document is one of the fundamental freedoms to which people living under the yoke of dictatorship aspire .
Possession of an identity card is the best means of protection against arbitrary treatment for the Union 's citizens .
Madam President , this debate concerns one of the fundamental aspects of the European Union : the free movement of persons .
But this did not happen .
We had freedom of movement for goods , services and capital , but not for people .
You can see this if you go to the United Kingdom , to mention just one example , where there are still immigration controls under the old legislation , European Union or no European Union .
So what we are talking about here is the move from a financial Union to a citizens ' Union .
It is absolutely ridiculous that it has taken us until now , in 1996 , to hold such a debate , when the planned measures should have been introduced by 1992 at the latest .
The proposed directive on the elimination of controls on persons crossing internal frontiers is really what this debate is all about .
As a representative of the people , I think that the national governments are at fault here .
The Dublin Treaty on asylum policy has been in the pipeline for years and still has not come into force .
This is extremely regrettable .
The ELDR Group feels that the European Parliament must adopt a clear position here .
But there is a political connection between the two issues , and it is up to the national governments to take the necessary measures as quickly as possible .
Today , Parliament must consider what it really wants .
In our view , we have to be realistic .
The Commission and Parliament must join forces in sending a message to the Council of Ministers that freedom of movement needs to be introduced , and it needs to be introduced quickly .
If the Council then fails to do so , it will have to account for its actions in public .
Madam President , I should like to make a number of comments on the three proposals for directives .
The first is that Parliament 's position has always been that , in order to make the free movement of persons a reality , all restrictions on travel and residence must be removed .
In the particular case of workers and their families , the Member States have an obligation to eliminate controls at internal frontiers .
However , the corresponding Commission proposal makes a right enshrined in the Treaties subject to new conditions , on the grounds that accompanying measures must be introduced in order to make possible the abolition of these controls .
Implementation of the Schengen Convention has demonstrated that it is quite possible to eliminate controls without introducing accompanying measures ; and to promote such measures is to undermine the right to free movement .
We are opposed to that .
We must not acknowledge a legal link between the abolition of controls on persons and the accompanying measures .
Turning now to other matters , the single market comprises an area without internal frontiers . This implies that the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is guaranteed .
Consequently , anyone who is legally present in the Community must have the right to travel within it without any kind of restriction or discrimination .
It should be borne in mind that Articles 3 and 7a refer to the free movement of persons , not of citizens .
Such treatment is discriminatory .
Otherwise , there will be an inconsistency between the free movement of capital and goods and that of persons .
Such an approach will undermine the Union 's political credibility .
The free movement of persons contributes to the meeting of cultures and the development of democracy .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , what we were promised was open frontiers , unrestricted freedom of movement , and no more controls .
How often have we heard it said that Europe was a single territory ?
But that was - and is - a lie .
No other European promise has been broken so often as the promise of a frontier-free Europe .
It is now patently obvious that the order of priorities in Europe today is : goods first , then services , then capital .
Those are the only priorities - or if people are a priority , it is only some people , not all of them .
Is this a viable way for Europe to function ?
No , it is not , because the frontier-free market must apply not only to prunes and potatoes , but also to people !
Since 1 January 1993 , we have been bending an article of the Treaty .
That article is becoming meaningless .
Article 7a is being breached , because controls are still in operation , from London to Athens and from Stockholm to Munich .
The governments of Europe have adopted a take-it-or-leave-it attitude to the old legal principle that pacta sunt servanda .
However , that cannot be our position , nor should it be the position of the Commission .
But in the case of freedom of movement , the Commission has failed to perform its most specific task .
Instead of being the guardian of the Treaties , it runs the risk of becoming nothing more than the Council 's henchman .
Following the legal episodes of which we are aware , the Commission has the credit of moving our endless task forward once again .
I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Commissioner Monti for his prudence and courage , even if this initiative does not go as far as our group would wish .
The need to safeguard the Union 's security is put forward as an argument for restricting freedom of movement .
But freedom and security go hand in hand .
Madam President , this debate today is surreal .
You heard correctly : ' whatever their justification ' .
We are unable to agree with this extremist approach to the abolition of border controls , for a number of reasons .
Secondly , within the Union itself , illegal trafficking - especially of drugs - has increased .
No : freedom of movement is not hindered by appropriate controls at the Union 's internal frontiers ; on the contrary , those controls serve to protect our citizens ' freedoms !
The proposals for directives which the Commission is presenting to us today are therefore totally inappropriate .
Not only must the Council reject them , but the Intergovernmental Conference must rewrite Article 7a .
The situation with regard to these directives on the abolition of the Union 's internal frontiers is exactly parallel .
I imagine that you have no explanation to give me because , of course , the Council did not even bother to answer our request .
But it is a shame that it should not be here .
Madam President , regardless of the fates which these directives might be reserved a word of thanks to Commissioner Monti and Rapporteurs Ford and Linzer on the excellent work they have carried out so far .
Madam President , this incident is one of the most serious and gross violations of inter-institutional dialogue .
Madam President , the challenge has been thrown down and the accusation has been made .
The Council has been acting behind the backs of the Commission and the European Parliament in bad faith .
We are owed an explanation , a justification , a notice and some information .
We are at least owed a posture of seriousness .
We will wait as long as is necessary and until this takes place we think that trust has been broken in the very minimum of interinstitutional ethics . Everything in its place .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , as other speakers have already said , there are four freedoms in the internal market .
Three are geared to economic interests , whilst one is the focus of popular expectation in Europe .
Three of them - the economic freedoms - have been achieved , but the free movement of persons has not become a reality .
I wish to know why this should be ?
We are told that freedom for people represents a greater risk .
Goods have to be given free access to markets , even if they do not meet the standards or conform to the traditions or safety expectations of the Member States .
But we are told that it is people who represent the risk .
On the contrary , we are facing much greater risks as a result of the free movement of goods , currencies and services .
Many people are prepared to tolerate those risks only because of the promise to introduce free movement of persons .
By delaying and failing to fully implement freedom of movement of persons , the Union is denying the rights of its own people .
To restrict freedom of travel to citizens of the Union , and to continue to make it difficult even for them , is to deny Europe 's openness to the world .
It means that the fears of a Fortress Europe are being borne out by Union policy .
Madam President , freedom to travel is probably the most important element in creating the internal market as an area without internal frontiers .
Implementing this fundamental freedom will meet the expectations of many citizens of the Member States .
For several decades , the people of the former communist countries were denied the fundamental freedom to travel .
It is therefore all the more important that no one - and particularly not those people - should be treated as a second-class citizen within the Union , not least at the internal frontiers .
I believe that woman should consider very seriously taking action as an individual citizen for illegal imprisonment .
I believe that free movement is not an objective of the Treaty but is a fundamental , constitutional right .
That is something without which the European Union cannot operate .
Therefore , if individual citizens are in a position to enforce Article 7a either directly or indirectly then the free movement will be enhanced .
The so-called accompanying measures and the Schengen Agreement are both excuses for trying to avoid the central issue of Article 7a .
If it is said that the so-called Monti proposals brought forward now will be vetoed in the Council of Ministers , that does not mean the end of all of this , that Article 7a somehow disappears .
It remains an obligation under which the Commission has to work and it remains something on which the Commission has to take action .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament has always adopted a very clear position on the issue of the free movement of persons , based on two principles to which other speakers have referred .
Firstly , the free movement of persons is an obligation under the Treaty which should have been carried out by 31 December 1992 at the latest , without any preconditions .
The House rejects this position .
Is Parliament supposed to be pleased that nationals of non-member countries are finally to have the right to travel ?
Secondly , it also means the end for freedom of movement as a Community issue .
The Commission , the European Parliament and the Court of Justice will be completely sidelined .
Madam President , I am sure we will all support the aims and principles of these reports .
I wish to speak mainly in relation to the Linzer report and I very much welcome some of the changes that have been made by way of amendment .
That should not be a major factor , and I very much welcome these proposals .
We need to be realistic .
We cannot open the borders until passage across the external frontiers and the rules on asylum and visas have been settled .
Borders are a sensitive matter .
National frontiers are a central part of many people 's consciousness .
The population is simply not prepared to accept the consequences of the absence of border controls .
Furthermore , many people in Denmark are employed to carry out border controls , and we shall also have the problem of explaining things to them .
That is what the consequences will be if we do not remain calm , but plunge headlong into open borders in Europe .
That is why , back in July 1995 , I had the Commission adopt the proposals now before Parliament .
I can only share the feelings expressed by a majority in this House .
What does an individual or society usually do when it wishes to take action ?
It sets itself a goal , an objective , and decides on the means by which to achieve it .
But what are we seeing today ?
Why has the Schengen agreement enabled progress to be made in this area , whilst the Union has been marking time ?
Quite simply , because the countries belonging to Schengen agree both on the objective and the appropriate means of achieving it .
In our case , the objective itself is rejected by at least one Member State .
Could it be that these foundations , so vital for democracy and the rule of law , are irreconcilable with the safeguarding of public order and security ?
Certainly not , in my view .
This does not mean to say that I cannot understand the concerns which have been expressed by the Home Affairs Ministers .
The free movement of persons inevitably raises questions of security and public order which must not be underestimated .
I would make an appeal to the House , if I may , as it comes to vote on the amendments to the Commission 's proposal .
So I deny that there is any intention to make the accompanying measures and the actual elimination of intra-Community controls contingent on one another .
There is a link , however , and it is more political than legal in nature , since our citizens do have concerns about security .
The Commission therefore cannot accept those amendments which eliminate all links between these two aspects : freedom on the one hand , and security on the other .
I fear that by removing this link , we would not actually be doing anything to help achieve freedom of movement .
The Commission can accept four of the other five amendments , in other words Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 5 and 6 , since they are aimed at consolidating the legal basis of the proposal .
The only amendment contained in Mr Lehne 's report seems to me to overstep this particular mark , and I am unable to accept it .
I think that all the legal and political implications of this very sensitive problem need to be assessed carefully .
Like goods , services and capital , persons too should be able to move around freely .
We are duty-bound to achieve this goal , but we shall only be able to do so if all internal border controls are eliminated .
Let me end , Madam President , by referring to what has been highlighted by various speakers , namely the initiative by the presidency .
In the course of Council business , the presidency put forward an initiative of its own at the meeting of Steering Group I on 8 and 9 July .
However , in view of the importance which I attach to this problem , I admit that this new initiative worries me personally for more than one reason .
In fact , my concerns are threefold , and relate both to the link with our proposal for a directive on the right to travel , and to the content of the initiative and its legal basis .
I believe Parliament shares this point of view , especially since that legal basis is the one which preserves its prerogatives .
In reality it will merely allow a third-country citizen to present himself at the border , armed with a residence permit but without a visa .
Furthermore , this is a step back from the Schengen Convention , which already confers this right to travel .
In addition , the absence of the right of entry implies a need to maintain controls at internal borders , in order to check whether entry onto that territory can be authorized .
In conclusion , I wish to stress that the thoughts which I have expressed thus far about this presidency initiative commit no one but myself .
Nevertheless , I shall not hesitate to make my concerns known to all my fellow Commissioners , inviting them to determine as soon as possible the strategy to be followed .
For my part , I would invite you , the European Parliament , to determine your own clear position on this problem .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
( The sitting was suspended at 10.40 a.m. and resumed at 10.50 a.m. )
Commission statement on BSE
I give the floor to Mr Santer , President of the Commission .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , BSE is a serious matter .
The Commission has treated it as such from the outset , and I myself have resolved to treat it as such .
Since March , I have personally involved myself in this matter .
You know my position , and that of the Commission .
Public health is our prime concern , and scientific evidence is our only guide .
It is on the basis of this approach that the Commission defines its measures , and that on 27 March it adopted a strategy for confining the disease .
This strategy has been clearly endorsed by both the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance .
By rejecting the British Government 's appeal for the lifting of the ban , the Court explicitly confirmed the Commission 's steadfast position .
It clearly underlined the fact that the export ban forms part of a strategy in which overwhelming importance is attached to the protection of public health .
In addressing this issue , the Commission has never concealed its guiding principles .
I see absolutely no reason why it would have carried out a policy of disinformation on such a sensitive issue .
As you requested , Mr President , I am prepared to submit the results of our investigations to the House today .
In this way , I hope to be able to demonstrate that the various reports which Members may have read or heard recently give a totally distorted image of the Commission 's action .
What is the situation , therefore ?
Mr Castille 's memorandum was an unrecorded note for the file .
Furthermore , it was not a minute of the meeting , but a personal opinion .
It was not addressed to either the Commissioner with responsibility for consumer protection or - with all the more reason - to the Commission as a whole .
In his note , Mr Castille refers , and I quote , to ' the representatives of the Commission ' .
The Danish delegate 's comments are borne out by the notes of the Irish delegation .
The other delegations stated that the BSE issue has never been addressed in this way , either by the Commission or by the Member States ' representatives in the Veterinary Committee .
The Italian delegation went so far as to say that if such an approach had been proposed by the Commission , it would have been forcibly rejected by the Member States .
That much is clear , I believe .
That is the extent of the information which I have been able to obtain concerning a meeting which took place six years ago .
In any event , the Commission should be judged on its actions .
Does organizing a conference of this kind and publishing its results in their entirety , ladies and gentlemen , constitute a disinformation strategy ?
I do not intend to review at present what has been done since 1990 to combat BSE .
The Commission has systematically based its proposed measures on the best available scientific advice .
And whenever new elements have appeared , the Commission has taken them - and will continue to take them - into account .
I would stress that we are faced with a complex and complicated problem , with regard to which there are - unfortunately - still no absolute scientific certainties .
I come now to a second matter which has caused a great deal of concern .
I refer to the suspicions regarding the illegal export of British beef .
It goes without saying that such exports would be fraudulent .
Consequently , this matter must be taken extremely seriously .
In this context too , however , we must not be carried away by emotion .
We must get to the bottom of things .
And that is what the Commission is doing .
We have written to Mr Seehofer , the German Health Minister , to ascertain his reasons for notifying the ministers of the German Länder .
We have written to all the Agriculture Ministers in the Union , calling on them to exercise increased vigilance .
We have also asked them to carry out inquiries and forward all useful information on this subject to the Commission .
My colleague , Mr Fischler , has interceded with his British counterpart in order to make sure that the UK authorities are ensuring full compliance with the export ban .
Lastly , we have instructed our own antifraud unit , UCLAF , to investigate any possible irregularities .
To date , the only written replies which the Commission has received are those from Mr Seehofer and the Italian Agriculture Minister .
I place them at Parliament 's disposal .
This does not mean that the Commission should not examine these allegations closely .
It will continue to do so , and if there is found to be fraud , the perpetrators will have to be severely punished .
The Commission will insist that the Member States assume their responsibilities .
Indeed , the customs and veterinary services , which fall within the jurisdiction of the Member States , must do their job .
As for the Commission , it is doing its job .
Any kind of information - however improbable - will be examined .
We shall take no risks , and we shall act with transparency .
We shall assume our responsibilities .
It is in this way that we shall serve the public 's interest .
Added to the revelation of this note - why such agitation on the Commission 's benches ?
- are the rumours of illegal circumvention of the ban on exports of British beef .
Since this last matter is now before the Italian courts , I shall not dwell on it .
The impact of these revelations is devastating !
Admittedly , the Commission of which Mr Santer is President is not responsible .
Admittedly , the official responsible in 1990 may well be in retirement .
Admittedly , it is probable that no Commissioner saw the note in 1990 .
However , none of this excuses us from drawing the necessary lessons from what happened in 1990 .
It is because we respect the Commission 's work , and because the Commission must be above all suspicion , that we wish things to be that way .
What does this note reveal ?
This attitude was born , in certain countries , of the triumphant economic liberalism of the 1980s .
The creation of the single market - in which attention is focused on the economic dimension at the expense of the social and environmental dimensions - is the extension of this attitude at European level .
Secondly , it reveals an incredible blindness to the concerns which had already been expressed at the time by the parties involved .
I shall cite no more than the written question on this subject submitted by my colleague Mr Happart in May 1990 , and the Agriculture Commissioner 's subsequent bland reply .
Lastly , it reveals a wish to create a lack of clarity in the provision of information , or even to misinform : a refusal to ensure transparency which is absolutely scandalous in a modern democratic institution .
What lessons must we draw from this matter , therefore ?
The first is that it is not a question of apologizing swiftly and turning to the business at hand , but of undertaking to bring about a profound change in attitude and approach .
That , Mr President , is the real scandal .
The Socialist Group will examine very carefully and calmly the explanation which the President of the Commission has just given to Parliament .
I should like to thank him for that explanation , since I believe that it is extremely important that he has provided the House with this very precise information .
We shall , of course , be adopting a resolution , but that is not enough : our group will be considering the appropriateness of calling for a committee of inquiry .
In the debate in this House on 12 June 1990 , I called for all BSEinfected herds to be destroyed .
Of course , we have to see this in the light of the scientific advice , because the scientists ' findings have emerged only in a piecemeal way , and as yet we have no definite conclusions .
Not only the scientific dimension , but also the impact of consumer reaction , was simply underestimated .
You have been right to bring pressure to bear through the decisions you have now taken .
I should like to stress that point in particular , and to express my approval .
However , there has also been a series of gaffes , such as the failure to implement in good time the standards for disposing of animal carcasses .
The decisions taken in 1990 should have been implemented by December 1991 , and you know what has happened up to now .
But I would also say this : as far as I am aware , a committee of inquiry would bring nothing new before the House .
A committee of inquiry could provoke another over-reaction by consumers and the media , and in the end that would mean the farmers affected having to pay dearly for this a second time .
I would also ask for your assurance that the programme of culling is being carried out systematically , and that the interim research results will be made available promptly to the parliamentary committee responsible .
I believe that this would be the best means of making good past omissions .
On the one hand , there are bewildered and panic-stricken consumers , who believe that part of the truth has been concealed from them - something which helps to maintain a devastating climate of fear .
On the other , there is a whole economic sector , from breeders to processors and distributors , which is on the verge of despair because its very survival is under threat .
It has the feeling that the matter is still being treated as a sectoral problem , when in fact it is the whole functioning of the Community institutions which is at issue .
Two recent incidents give us cause for concern .
Previous speakers have referred to Mr Castille 's note .
However , we had to wait until 1994 before legislation prohibiting the use of meat-based meal was adopted at European level .
We believe , therefore , that the Union 's institutions did not function as they should have .
We have the impression that , at the time , everything happened as if the watchword were ' do not make waves ' .
The result today is that everything is being swept away by a tidal wave .
For we know that in this sector too , the Member States ' controls are inadequate .
Fourthly , by enacting common rules making the identification of carcasses compulsory throughout the European Union , with a view to increasing the transparency of marketing networks .
Fifthly , by making available the financial resources that are necessary , on the one hand to eradicate the disease and , on the other , to rescue operators in the beef and veal sector .
We need to be open and honest .
My group will wait to see this report before it decides whether to support the calls for a committee of inquiry to be set up .
The second question is what the Commission should do next .
There are still so many unknown factors associated with BSE , and more research is needed .
What role should the Commission play here ?
What role is it already playing in coordinating all the research that is currently being done in Europe , and what will the financial implications of this be ?
The third point my group feels is important is to restore the balance in the market for beef .
This could be a difficult process , but one of the things that might help would be the introduction of a European quality mark for beef .
There must also be fair competition with other measures .
Germany has now announced that it will not abide by the Commission 's decision concerning the export of certain products from the United Kingdom .
What does the Commission intend to do about this ?
What does it think about France 's decision to ban the use of meatbased meal in cattle fodder ?
We need to have fair competition everywhere .
That situation continued for four years , during which almost 75 % of the declared cases of BSE were recorded .
If risks existed , it was during this period .
If legislation was necessary , it was during this period .
If there was a need for inspections , it was never so acute as during this period .
The Commission must explain the reasons for its lack of action during the period from 1990 to 1994 .
If we wish to avoid the word disinformation , we must talk about transparency , and it cannot be argued that the Commission 's conduct has been transparent .
The scientific basis for lifting the ban on gelatine is unclear , and the Commission has not provided us with the information requested in paragraph 6 of Parliament 's resolution of last June .
It is essential to compare the report submitted by the European Association of Gelatine Manufacturers , on which the Commission based its proposal for the partial lifting of the ban , with independent scientific opinions .
We must learn from experience : deregulation and the pursuit of competitiveness by the intensification of farming have created this problem .
Experience has shown that when decisions are determined by economic - or indeed political - considerations , the consequences are grave .
In the past , important decisions have been determined by the will to complete the single market or ensure the success of a summit .
We must not fall into past mistakes .
In all future decisions , the slightest risk must be eliminated .
In this affair , there are interests , winners , losers and economic costs - but above all , risks to public health .
And there are also responsibilities .
Some might say that the work of a such committee will produce new headlines in the press which have a damaging effect on consumption .
However , we already have experience of what happens when decisions are postponed or adopted in a half-hearted way .
Moreover , the long incubation period of this disease and the dangers already recognized will ensure that the press will continue to be provided with headlines in the immediate future .
For all these reasons , the European United Left will support the setting-up of a committee of inquiry which focuses on the political decisions adopted , with a view to safeguarding the public interest .
I am coming to an end , Mr President .
As Mr Fayot said , we wish to contribute to ensuring that the market is made subject to the laws of democracy and the need to protect public health .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioner Fischler , the BSE disaster is a chain of misconduct , political misjudgement , and failure to assume political responsibility .
We all know what the result was for the cattle .
However , there was also a failure of judgement on the part of the Commission in thinking that this disease would not take on such proportions , but would gradually die out .
In saying this , you are either making a joke or being cynical .
If you had come clean about it , we would not have needed a committee of inquiry .
The problem is that you did not come clean .
That is what matters now , and that is what must be resolved .
The question of a committee of inquiry is also a question of how rigorous future measures will be .
That is what matters , and that is why our group is in favour of setting up the committee of inquiry .
We must do our duty , Mr Böge !
For whatever the merits of your statement , Mr President of the Commission , there is a need for persons outside the Commission to carry out an investigation - and through a procedure in which both sides are heard .
Today , Parliament is beginning to respond in the manner that is required .
This note reveals what is , to say the least , the inefficient organization of rules and practices within the Commission , and in the Commission 's relations with the Member States .
Quite rightly , the public wants to know , and it wants transparency .
That is why stalling tactics used to delay inquiries or limit their scope are based on a complete misjudgement .
If we wish to protect the wholesale and retail distribution networks , there must be effective supervision of the whole chain from producer to consumer .
And Mrs Poisson asked the Commission a single question : what has the Commission done since 1990 ?
The reply was unequivocal : your predecessor , Mr Delors , had said that the Commission was not well informed on the subject and could do nothing .
Commissioner Fischler did not furnish him with a reply on this point .
The Commission 's planned measures will cover only 20 % of the losses suffered by our cattle breeders .
In France , for example , losses in the beef and veal sector are currently in excess of FF 15 billion , but the planned compensation amounts to only FF 3 billion .
Who will pay the difference ?
No , Mr President , it was not an insignificant note .
We all know - from being familiar with the mysterious workings of the Commission - that such internal papers indicate the broad outlines of policy .
In conclusion , Mr President of the Commission , in the face of these failures to reply , you oblige me to assume my responsibilities .
The Europe of Nations Group will call for a parliamentary committee of inquiry to be set up , but Parliament must assume all its responsibilities ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , Commissioners , you are , at the very least , accused of a crime .
In your defence , you describe to us what you have done since March 1996 .
It was impossible for you not to know !
You tell us : ' We have no motive . Why would we have done that ?
That is your motive .
You concealed the contamination by meat-based meal in order to conceal the contamination by your ideas .
Above and beyond the infection by meat-based meal , the public was being poisoned by your ideas , Mr Santer !
And , in terms of the Vienna Treaty , you violated the people 's right of consent .
You secured the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty by invalidating that right of consent .
Naturally , we agree with Mr de Villiers .
It is not a question of setting up a committee of inquiry , but of the Commission assuming its political responsibilities .
In other times , history 's great poisoners suffered a different fate .
Mr President , I do not know why I always draw the short straw and have to speak after speeches like that - but there you are .
We must all be worried that the Commission was so concerned about the reports of the disease 's existence that apparently it decided to deny it altogether .
More importantly , at some level within the Commission we are told it was decided to keep all the information away from the public domain or as far away from the public domain as might be possible .
It also had the information pointed out to it at that time and managed to keep it out of the public domain .
It is not surprising , therefore , that there is very little consumer confidence in the beef industry across Europe .
That is true not just in Britain but elsewhere as well , in Germany , Italy , France and so on .
We need to have the plan in place and after that we can begin to tackle the question of consumer confidence .
There is no point in lifting a ban if no one is going to buy the stuff anyway .
It has to be a serious committee of inquiry and not simply an attempt to pin the blame for what appears to be an essentially British disease on other people or institutions .
The committee of inquiry , if it is set up , must be seen as a positive contribution to a European solution for this whole crisis .
We have to look where we are and , following the agreement that we were relieved to receive from Florence on the framework programme , there has been considerable progress .
We should be encouraged by the fact that the issue is back where it belongs , that is at scientific and at veterinary level .
In addition every effort is being made to carry out a selected cull among the dairy herds that have suffered from BSE .
This of course has had a devastating effect on cattle farmers , cattle farmers throughout Europe , and the clean beef prices have been dramatically affected in the market place .
The President of the Commission has given us a very firm answer from the Commission on these two points , and therefore I would not wish to dwell on them .
It suggested that the United Kingdom should not publish the results of research .
Well as the President of the Commission said , quite clearly , that could be regarded as a joke but certainly it was not a paper that was received by the United Kingdom Government .
The additional intervention measures which have been taken are helpful , and the funding of research is crucial .
Indeed , if scientists could find a foolproof test to diagnose the disease , then it would be a major breakthrough in animal science .
Perhaps I might ask Mr Fischler if there is any progress made in this direction .
He might also care to comment on the availability of the rendering facilities since much of the product is presently going into cold storage .
I support also those who call for a European quality assurance scheme on beef and I support the call for the full identification of all animals .
Mr President , I have followed this matter since March of this year .
I represent the biggest beef-producing constituency in England and the area with the highest number of BSE cases .
I sometimes wonder if excessive concentration on detail is not turning our brains spongy .
Clearly we must have tight controls on the export of meat and meat products from the UK .
Clearly it is likely that some would have been in transit at the time of the ban , perhaps to third countries , and may have escaped those controls .
I am pleased that the Commission has asked the anti-fraud unit to investigate any cases of fraudulent trading .
But on the overall issue and the question of the cover-up , we need to take a wider view .
This issue in a sense has been the United Kingdom 's Chernobyl .
Our failure to act at the first warning signs meant that the problem became worse .
It got out of control . We do not know its effect on human health if any .
But clearly there is substantial public concern and that public worry has been affecting us all .
As a result , safety procedures have been improved .
Measures have been put in place to eradicate the disease .
But what some people have still not realized is that this is truly a European problem .
If we want our beef market to recover we must match our resolute deeds with reasoned words .
You said , Mr President , that we must not get carried away with emotion .
I am pleased that you have written to Mr Seehofer to question him about his actions .
Yes , let us have an internal inquiry in the Commission .
That is surely only proper .
But let us not blow up the problem , let us clear it up .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , dura lex sed lex .
That has not been and is not the case .
This question received an evasive and untruthful reply from Commissioner Fischler .
So what can we say ?
Should we play cat and mouse ?
That is no use to anyone .
All these accusations create a climate of distrust in the public authorities whose duty it is to regularize this immensely difficult situation , which is affecting all of us and not just the Member State most directly concerned .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , firstly , I should like to say that we welcome this morning 's statement .
With the benefit of hindsight , however , I believe that it is clear that the Commission 's approach should not be imitated in the management of this issue .
To suggest that not talking about BSE would prevent unfavourable market reactions is quite simply to show contempt for Europe 's citizens .
However , the solution must not lie solely in rectifying matters for the future .
There is also a need to look back and provide political remedies for the mistakes of the past .
We can express our regret at the situation in the beef and veal sector , the growth of stocks by 600 000 tonnes and the 11 % fall in consumption .
However , any measures taken will be useless if consumers believe that they are being deceived by the Community authorities .
Whoever drew up this note considered that market imperatives were more important than public health .
The disinformation measures have only served to aggravate the problem .
The content of the note in question amounts to turning immorality into a commercial rule .
Let us hope that this unfortunate episode will enable us to ensure that , in future , the protection of public health is placed before any other consideration .
Commissioner Fischler will answer shortly on the more specific aspects of this issue .
This is now the fourth time that I have appeared before Parliament to talk about the so-called ' mad cow ' crisis .
That is the approach which this Commission - and the previous Commission - has always followed .
This statement can be backed up , moreover , by some very specific facts .
The note in question dates from October 1990 .
It was following this conference that the scientific research was started .
Furthermore , a number of measures were taken by the previous Commission in this respect .
It is in Parliament 's resolution , not in an internal Commission document , that these words are to be found .
Let us turn now to the document in question .
It was , as I said earlier , a note from an official .
My statement was based , therefore , on the results of the inquiry carried out by the chairman of the BSE interdepartmental working party , on our instructions .
It will therefore be clear to the House that we desire transparency .
Nobody has anything to gain from a lack of transparency in this matter .
With your permission , Mr President , I shall now give the floor to Commissioner Fischler , who will go into detail on certain matters which concern him more particularly .
We cannot effectively discuss ways of regenerating consumer confidence while that confidence is being shaken by unresolved suspicions .
I have taken all the measures available to me to help resolve matters .
So far , no Member States have informed us of anything more than suspicions .
You yourselves are also aware that in the Council 's conclusions and the Commission 's decisions it has been stated clearly on every occasion that health interests have absolute priority .
I shall be glad to take up the suggestion that was made today of pursuing the internal investigations and reporting back to the House .
However , I also believe it is important - as was said earlier - not just to resolve what has happened in the past , but to concern ourselves with the future .
And here too , top priority will again be given to health measures .
With your permission , I shall deal briefly with a fact which was reported in the media today and which concerns our decision on gelatine .
In the meantime , on 26 June , we received a new , additional report .
It will be considering the issue in depth tomorrow . Meanwhile , the Scientific Veterinary Committee has already discussed this question many times .
Clearly , we can only have the latest scientific basis available at any given time , and we have to base our decisions on that .
One further important point is the reorganization of our rendering industry in all the Member States .
Measures have also been announced for the transitional period to ensure that no potentially hazardous animalbased or bone meal can find its way into human food or animal feed .
Another very important step , in my view , will be the improvement of our stock identification systems as soon as possible .
We know that there have also been some major scientific breakthroughs .
We are due to receive a proposal from his research group in the early autumn .
