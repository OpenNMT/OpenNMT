Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 28 March 1996 .
Welcome
I bid you a warm welcome !
Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of the sitting of Thursday , 28 March 1996 have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Mr President , on behalf of my fellow-members from the Committee on Agriculture I should like to ask you to change a few things in the voting about the BSE resolution .
Obviously one or two things have gone wrong .
Points 16 and 17 now contradict one another whereas the voting showed otherwise .
I shall be passing on to you some comments which you could perhaps take up with regard to the voting .
I will have to look into that , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten .
I cannot say anything at this stage .
We will consider the matter .
Mr President , it concerns the speech made last week by Mr Fischler on BSE and reported in the Minutes .
Perhaps the Commission or you could clarify a point for me .
It would appear that a speech made at the weekend by Mr Fischler indicates a change of his position .
I welcome this change because he has said that he will eat British beef and that the ban was imposed specifically for economic and political reasons .
Could somebody clarify that he has actually said this please , Mr President , because it is a change of views .
Mr Sturdy , I cannot see what that has to do with the Minutes .
Mr President , on exactly the same point as Mr Sturdy has raised .
If Commission Fischler has made this statement , then he has said that it is not a matter of public health .
Mr Smith , the same applies to your point ; it has nothing to do with the Minutes .
Mr President , again on BSE .
If Mr Fischler has changed his views does this mean the Commission has ?
This was actually referred to in the Minutes .
He said that any funding would also go towards supporting workers who had directly lost their jobs .
So far nothing has come of this in any scheme that has been put forward .
Does this mean the Commission has changed its view on supporting workers who have lost their jobs through this scare ?
I note that there are no comments on the Minutes .
( Parliament approved the Minutes )
Now that is clearly a fraud on the French taxpayer as well as a fraud on the European citizens .
Can we ask the Bureau to look into this fact .
Can we ask you as President to make sure that is happening with the taxpayers ' money for which we are collectively responsible .
Mr Tomlinson , would you please give me the documents concerned .
Then I will look into the matter , both in the presidency and with the other organizations in question .
You yourself know best how difficult and complicated the legal situation is between Parliament and the firms contracted to build the hemicycle .
After all , we have in you an expert who is in any case closely concerned with these matters .
Mr President , I should like to deal very briefly with two matters .
Thank you !
Order of business
The next item is the order of business .
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 11 April 1996 pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed .
No amendments have been proposed .
Mr President , I should like to ask a question .
We were too late to hand it in , but it has been discussed with a number of Members .
It is the following .
I think that in view of present events in the Middle East , we ought to ask whether the Council can make a statement on Wednesday afternoon about the way things are going .
We note that the situation is changing every day .
We see that the French Government has sent a mediator .
We hear nothing from the presidency .
Nor have we heard anything , unfortunately , from the Commission .
That is reason enough for us to be put in the picture .
I should like to ask you to see whether it is possible for the Italian presidency to do that on Wednesday afternoon .
We recognize that the agenda is very full .
Then we could deal with Chernobyl some time later .
I offer that as a suggestion , Mr President . If you would like to arrange things some other way so that we do not need to take Chernobyl off the agenda that would suit us just as well .
Could we leave it to you , Mr President , to see whether the Council is prepared to make a statement on the Middle East and what is happening in the Lebanon ?
Could we then look to you to see what is possible .
I am reluctant , as I know many of my colleagues are , to remove Chernobyl from the agenda , as suggested by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten .
However , it would be possible for us to come back to the issue of Chernobyl which does not have such immediacy although it is the tenth anniversary .
We could take this in two weeks ' time , whereas the issue of Lebanon is crucial at this moment .
Perhaps , Mr President , we could ask you to look at this with the Council and see what would be possible .
Mr President , I am glad to support Mrs Oomen-Ruijten 's suggestion , supported by Mrs Green - with one slight reservation .
I think that as a matter of courtesy we should naturally ask the Council whether it is ready to make a statement .
I understand the French Government 's motives for trying to mediate .
That was previously the case in the crisis between Turkey and Greece , and then Mr Holbrooke rightly said :
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think it is important that we should discuss the situation in the Middle East this week .
We all agree on that .
But I think it is equally important that we discuss Chernobyl this week .
I cannot support this proposal .
The whole world is talking about the tenth anniversary .
A major conference was held in Vienna .
There was a tribunal .
And then we say we will postpone it to whenever .
I really think it would show Parliament in a poor light if we do not discuss it on Wednesday .
There are various other options .
We can listen to the Council on the subject on Wednesday morning , but please not just in a week 's time .
At a time when the whole world is discussing Chernobyl and the effects of that disaster , we in this Parliament cannot say , we shall hold back and say nothing about it !
Mr President , I have already given you the reasons why the Council should make a statement about the bombardment of Lebanon .
That would be a bad sign for the Intergovernmental Conference and for the future of the European Union .
But I think , like Mrs Roth , that we cannot make the subject of Chernobyl and the subject of the Middle East compete in the ' free market for news items ' .
We must seek out the opportunity to discuss both subjects .
What is happening there is worrying and distressing because the whole peace process that has been under way for several months could be threatened .
Let me describe the situation to you as I see it .
First , let me please establish whether the Council is prepared and in a position to make a statement .
But it would be neither right nor a good idea to shorten that debate since the Italian President-in-Office of the Council will be here on Wednesday morning .
So the only possible compromise is to postpone the Gonzáles Álvarez report and cut Question Time by half an hour .
I realise that to do so would be at the cost of Members who have questions . That is regrettable .
It is not that we will satisfy everybody this way , but if we are to try to find a solution , I am convinced that is the only possible one .
The order of business for this week is thus established .
Energy efficiency
Many of the proposals for directives and action programmes planned by the Commission have for some obscure reason never seen the light of day .
The savings from the introduction of an energy certificate for buildings would have been far higher than that even .
This list could be extended forever .
It is clear that whenever the practical will is not there , subsidiarity is brought up as an argument .
Strictly speaking , it is the credibility of the EU that is at stake here .
The Commission and the Council have constantly declared how vital it is to reduce CO2 and to save energy .
The Council has set objectives in a series of resolutions , for example in its resolutions of 16.9.86 and 29.10.90 and in the commitments it made in Rio and Berlin .
So far , however , there has been no more than grandiloquent announcements and reams of paper .
The Commission itself estimates that the CO2 emissions will rise by up to 8 % in the period from 1995 to 2000 .
If it really is being serious , words must finally be followed by deeds .
We urgently need genuine measures to combat the greenhouse effect and increase energy efficiency .
The situation is too serious to allow for any further delay .
That is why the amendments tabled by that committee should quite definitely be adopted .
The objection that such programmes can only be disruptive given the current economic climate and unemployment level in many Member States is unacceptable and merely ridiculous .
For in addition to their environmental dimension , they can also have a substantial positive impact on the economy .
According to the Commission , apart from its effects on the quality of life , these savings would also have positive effects on employment .
Let me repeat that I deeply regret that the committee did not accept my proposal that we extricate ourselves from this unholy cooperation procedure and aim at a co-decision procedure .
It would have been more sensible for Parliament always to apply the co-decision procedure .
If we give the money we should also be able to say that we would like to see legislative measures .
For that is the decisive point here .
I think she is well placed through her excellent report to achieve consensus in the plenary session of Parliament .
Energy efficiency is of fundamental importance both to the environmental and the competitiveness policies of the European Union .
As far as the environment is concerned , we are a long way off meeting the targets which we set ourselves in Rio .
We are suffering widespread climate instability because of that failure .
Think of the purchasing power which those billions could release to our economy .
Larger firms are , of course , aware of this .
Our target through this programme has to be the smaller firms and individual households .
They must make the decisions which will allow us to save that energy and save that money .
If we look at the history we see very rapid action following the oil shock in 1973 .
Since then , however , there has been major regression tempered only by the recession which has hit most of our countries .
The energy / intensity use in most of the European Union is worsening .
That is unacceptable .
The SAVE I programme was very small beer , a very small amount of money .
It is being evaluated , fortunately , before we move on to SAVE II .
One would have hoped the lessons from SAVE I would be learnt . That is not so , as I shall explain later on .
One of the lessons from SAVE I was that far and away the best thing to do is to bring in binding legislation which Member States have to enforce .
There were ambitious plans for legislation . Very little of that legislation has appeared .
It is true that we have legislation on the efficiency of boilers , fridges and freezers , labelling , and there is more to come .
But that is not enough .
We know that the main obstacle has been the predictable resistance of manufacturers .
They have no vested interest in energy efficiency and that is clear from their stance .
Let us look at the lessons .
Firstly , legislation is what works .
Secondly , you must have targets and you must monitor them .
The target in SAVE II is not ambitious ; 1.5 % increase year-on-year is not ambitious .
I would like to see an indicative programme issued by the Commission and monitored throughout the Member States .
They help impoverished regions .
Of course the same would apply to third countries .
I would like to see far more emphasis in our dealings with countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean areas on energy efficiency .
One area which must be emphasized above all is transport .
Transport takes almost half the energy cost and it uses almost half the oil .
We have not done enough in that sector .
Then there are domestic and industrial appliances , insulation for the heating of homes , and in some parts of the EU for the cooling of homes .
There is a good home rating scheme developed in my own constituency which should be far more widespread .
This makes us competitive , remember .
We need millions of people to make decisions which do not seem obvious to them .
Employment would be greatly helped by an extension of energy efficiency . This has been proved in study after study .
I am therefore deeply disappointed at the negative attitude of the Council of Ministers which cannot even be bothered to get a proper legal base for the SAVE II programme .
That is indeed reprehensible , given the urgency .
I think we will see this week a very clear expression of the will of the European Parliament representing people in every Member State .
That will is to say : ' Let us have much stronger measures for energy efficiency ' .
SAVE II is nowhere near ambitious enough .
That consensus has led to a number of common conclusions which I will not spell out in detail now .
However , it is worth pointing out once again that with this programme we are seeking to promote environmental improvement and to increase the competitiveness of Europe 's undertakings .
The Commission 's proposal to treble the resources for the SAVE II programme , as compared with the SAVE I programme , is certainly encouraging .
SAVE II endeavours to strengthening pilot actions that were undertaken in the first programme and also makes provision for new actions .
As has already been said , the programme ignores the positive results that have stemmed from legislative measures and the possibility of achieving a further increase in energy efficiency via the same route .
I would therefore advise the Commission to look for a middle way , so as to provide an impetus to small and medium-sized enterprises in particular , as I said before .
However , it would also be useful if the Commission were to take account of the need to achieve convergence between the Member States in the area of energy efficiency .
Mr President , I support Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz 's report .
She introduced it with her usual efficiency .
It is important that we support the continuation of the SAVE energy efficiency programme with a budget of ECU 120m for the period from 1996 to 2000 .
The renewal of the SAVE programme may be timely as the European Commission reports that the carbon dioxide target is being exceeded by 5 % .
Indeed , according to estimates , carbon dioxide accounts for 50 % of the greenhouse gases now present in the atmosphere .
Between 1991 and 1994 the SAVE programme funded a total of 203 pilot projects in the energy efficiency field .
In Ireland alone we undertook 12 pilot projects with the assistance of SAVE funds .
So I fully agree with the objective to improve energy efficiency by a further 1.5 % per annum within the European Union .
It is important in this context that the SAVE initiatives should be coordinated with other European Union energy initiatives such as THERMIE and SYNERGY .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased first of all to compliment the rapporteur on the excellent report on SAVE II .
This report makes a contribution to the difficult but important battle for a sustainable environment and a sustainable development of our economy .
Liberals start with their own responsibility and do not shuffle it off on to succeeding generations .
That of course means that there must be sustainable management of natural resources .
There is a price-tag on pollution .
So the environmental costs of consumption and production must be made visible in the economy .
The Committee on Energy has approved 35 amendments , four of them from the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party .
I should like to explain two of them .
A shift , ladies and gentlemen , in the use of energy sources , in particular in the direction of renewable energy sources , could make these figures considerably more attractive .
That should be encouraged in the framework of SAVE II .
It is essential to apply modern energy technologies and to switch to cleaner industries in Eastern Europe .
That is good for the environment and good for the economy and benefits both the Union and third countries .
That is what makes this collaboration so significant .
Mr President , it is certainly appropriate that at least one representative of a Nordic state should take part in this debate on the programme for the promotion of energy efficiency .
There is quite a lot of snow too .
Of course , we cannot do anything about the forces of nature .
We can , however , do a lot to improve energy efficiency .
In Finland , for example , there are currently enormous quantities of wood , of waste wood , which nobody uses .
The directive on refrigerators , which the next speaker Mr Macartney has reported on , may even now be being debated in the Council .
We need to set more ambitious objectives and ensure that the old , wasteful sources of energy are modernized .
I hope that this SAVE II programme will be adopted but there is much that could be done to improve it .
I have to say that it is a bit like motherhood .
Everyone supports energy savings , everyone is in favour of motherhood .
But where are the real supports .
The Commission has failed with these proposals to give us real support , key legislative proposals .
Parliament has stepped in and , correctly , pointed this out .
We do not have very much time left before the year 2000 to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves .
Let us have some real legislative proposals this time around .
The most important thing we have done recently is to evaluate the SAVE programme .
We have done an excellent evaluation and have come up with the real result that you need legislative proposals .
We need teeth to make the SAVE proposals sink in .
Unless we get teeth the Member States will not do the work .
We will not get the results we need .
We have to harmonize with other programmes .
We have to harmonize with THERMIE and SYNERGY and we have to export these ideas to third countries , particularly the East .
But let us show an example ourselves .
Where are the SAVE programmes for the European Parliament ?
Where are the energy saving programmes for the Commission ?
Let us do some real work ourselves on our own buildings .
Buildings are shooting up here and in Brussels .
Where are the real energy saving proposals there ?
We pontificate about what third countries and peripheral states should do all the time .
Let us do something real here in the heart of Europe where we have money .
Let us do it legislatively and with fiscal instruments .
I do not accept that we cannot use fiscal instruments .
It is about time we got back to using them .
It is something which is fairly obvious when you state it but clearly it has profound implications for the people who live in those climates .
In particular , the Scots should take a leaf out of the book of the Finns , the Swedes and the Norwegians on how to insulate their houses .
A lot of lessons could be learned by our people and these could be applied right across Europe to everybody 's benefit .
Later on in this Parliament we shall be returning again to the subject of domestic freezers and fridges , which is a subject that often causes eyes to glaze over , I have to admit .
But when people realize how much energy the fridge or the freezer in their house consumes all the year round , I think they will realize this is important .
Do you believe the targets that you agreed to at Rio ?
SAVE I , which Parliament criticized for having insufficient finance and ambition , detailed 13 legal actions and standards that would be undertaken .
In practice , only four directives emerged and it is unacceptable that the present proposal makes no reference to the failure of SAVE I as a legislative programme .
For instance , we still have no directive on energy efficiency of buildings .
It is sad that the current proposal does not contain more ambitious targets for energy saving .
In order to meet the EU 's Rio commitments people have already said that a 2.5 % per annum improvement in energy efficiency is needed .
If the SAVE programme really is the cornerstone of the Community 's CO2 strategy - as the proposal states - then that strategy lies in tatters .
It is , however , all we have at the present and , to that extent , I commend Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz 's excellent report to the House .
Mr President , clearly we welcome this report .
In energy conservation everybody wins .
At one stroke it protects the environment , conserves resources , boosts the economy and saves consumers money at the same time .
At the time of Rio there was great excitement .
We believed in those targets .
This programme does not go far enough to meet those targets .
Energy strategy is a part of environmental policy and therefore must be decided at European level and that is why we must get serious .
So this is not enough .
I welcome this report very much , but it is only one part of the jigsaw .
Let us see the others .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz , for her very important report , and also the draftsmen of the opinions of the parliamentary committees .
The SAVE I programme which ended in 1995 was initially devised as an energy efficiency programme .
However , as it progressed it became the cornerstone of the European Union 's strategy for reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
However , we have also been guided by another factor , namely the lack of progress on the question of an energy tax .
And it is precisely that which has led us into developing SAVE II as a wider and fuller initiative .
I fully understand , and to a great extent share , the anxiety that very many Members , and in particular Mrs von Blottnitz , Mrs McNally and Mrs Ahern , have expressed regarding the programme 's legislative dimension .
Nevertheless , allow me to say here and now that the SAVE programme is not a framework for legislative initiatives by the Commission .
What this programme does provide , however , is the potential for the funding of actions such as studies to investigate the possibility of legislative measures and to prepare the drafting of such measures .
Please allow me at this point to deal with Mrs Pollack 's comment .
If we can make a reality of the very considerable energy-saving possibilities that exist we shall be able to reduce our energy dependency .
We shall also be able to revitalize our industry and , as Mr Argyros has said , small and mediumsized enterprises in particular .
In addition , we shall be able to reduce public sector spending and to promote the use of new energy technologies .
In my opinion the budget of 150 m ECU that we have set for SAVE II is very modest in relation to the political and economic benefits which will flow from this programme .
Energy and environmental problems are not , however , confined to the European Union .
In the countries of central and eastern Europe which are preparing for accession to the Union there is enormous scope for improvement in energy efficiency .
We have a duty to give them the opportunity to participate in SAVE II .
In addition , following a request from the countries of the European Economic Area , the programme will be open to Norway , Iceland and Liechtenstein .
We are also looking at the possibility of involving Cyprus and Malta .
Mr President , SAVE II is an important tool , a tool which can bring results only if it is given the fullest support .
I therefore request you to look upon SAVE II as a complementary action which is thus not intended as a substitute for actions taken by the Member States themselves .
With reference to the amendments , I have to say that the rapporteur has made an extremely important contribution .
The Commission can accept five amendments without reservation , namely Nos 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 and 8 .
As far as Amendment No 29 is concerned , the Commission can accept the spirit of the second part of that amendment .
We cannot accept the first , third and fourth parts because we do not wish to upset the existing agreement on comitology .
Allow me to say also , on a general note , that no legislative initiative by the Commission is dependent on approval being given to a particular programme .
Hence Amendments Nos 5 , 10 and 16 , which seek to commit the Commission to legislative initiatives , cannot be accepted at this point .
Amendments Nos 17 , 18 , 20 , 21 , 23 , 24 and 25 relate to new actions of low interest , and , of course , to the funding of them .
These actions are either already encompassed , at least in part , by the Commission 's text or are well outside its framework , or , in fact , are covered by other initiatives .
As a result they cannot be introduced into the text .
The Commission believes that respect for the treaties and balanced allocation of the budget are requirements that go without saying .
That being so , Amendments Nos 26 and 27 cannot be included in the text .
The same applies to Amendments Nos 30 and 35 which would reduce the flexibility of the programme management procedures .
The Commission supports complementarity between SAVE II and the corresponding national programmes and therefore cannot accept the blurring of this concept contained in Amendment No 31 .
Lastly , Amendment No 9 is not directly related to the potential for intervention built into the proposal in question and therefore it cannot be included .
Ladies and gentlemen , I hope that you will support this proposal following the improvements that have been made to its text via the amendments that are being accepted .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like you to tell me when you will be presenting the legislative proposals .
You said it would be very soon .
I would like you to be more precise .
Then you said this programme was useful for study purposes .
Do you not agree that we already have enough of those ?
You also said that of the thirteen legislative measures announced in SAVE I , nine had already been implemented .
That really is not true !
In fact only three of them have been implemented and that is the ones on hot water boilers , the labelling of household appliances and the labelling of freezers .
We are calling for legislative proposals and you say they have already been implemented .
Surely that is not the case .
The directive merely refers to the measures , while it is left open to the Member States whether they implement them or not .
But they have not done so .
There are no laws on this in my country and I am willing to bet they do not exist in most other Member States either .
That is precisely what we need in SAVE II .
After all , it is useless simply to leave the implementation of such measures to the Member States .
If you rate what you just read out as success , then it is of course clear that you will obtain a rate of nine out of thirteen .
But you will have to agree with me when I say that in real terms only three out of the thirteen have been implemented , namely the three I just mentioned .
All the rest is declarations of intent .
The reason for that is that six proposals were incorporated into one , and on that basis the number does become three .
But in actual fact the Commission presented about nine legislative proposals , and six of them were joined into one .
The Commission therefore believes that it has shown total consistency in exerting pressure from the European Union for the stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions .
Responsibility for the fact that we have not achieved our objectives does not lie with the Commission , and it is not for us to shoulder it .
Quite the reverse . We have the positive experience gained from the directive on refrigerators to draw on .
You will be aware that the Council adopted that directive at the end of the Spanish presidency last December . It is a pleasing outcome .
Of course , we are waiting for the second reading by the European Parliament before proceeding .
The debate is closed .
The vote on the Bloch von Blottnitz report will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Synergy programme
This proposal for a regulation is a response not only to a request from nonmember countries but also to the need for worldwide cooperation in the energy sector .
Ladies and gentlemen , the securing of energy sources and the security of those sources is , as you understand , a matter of the highest priority .
Given that , anything that contributes to the political , economic and social stability of those regions which hold the keys to the supply of energy must be supported .
Mr Soulier has provided some figures which indicate how the general energy picture is likely to evolve in the immediate future .
I will not repeat them , but I do agree .
As everyone knows , the European Union has been providing that assistance informally to those countries for at least the last 15 years .
We now believe that this is the best time ever to give SYNERGY a legal base and to establish it as a multiannual programme .
This request , this assessment , from the Commission must be supported .
This differentiated breakdown shows that the SYNERGY programme gives a greater financial contribution to the administrative costs than to the operational projects .
The companies certainly benefit from the Energy Charter and certainly have the financial resources to finance the Secretariat .
For that reason , the citizens of the EU cannot be asked to continue paying for this .
We need a change of energy policy .
Let me briefly raise three aspects .
Firstly , the 25 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions we puff into the air every year damage our climate and destroy our natural environment .
Secondly , the potential of nuclear energy is limited .
We already have some 120 000 tonnes of radioactive waste and nobody knows what is to be done with it .
Thirdly , of course there is a growing energy demand because everyone on this earth has a right to quality of life .
That is why the Commission 's proposal to develop a strategy of cross-frontier cooperation is most welcome .
Here I think three points are particularly important .
First , I consider it important for it to be made clear in an annex what direction the projects are to follow .
To create an abstract programme and then , as once put by a German football trainer , to take the line ' let 's see how we go ' is something we find unacceptable .
We must know exactly what measures will be implemented and how .
So in addition to the annex , it is equally important that we reappraise this programme on a continuous basis and receive reports on the activities undertaken on a continuous basis .
I am thinking of two important aspects here : the development of renewable energy sources and the development of rational energy use .
Other objectives will have to take second place . Cheaper energy and strengthening the global position of the energy industry are not urgent objectives of SYNERGY either .
Of course there are areas with a growing energy requirement in which renewable energy sources could be a decisive solution .
The second aspect on which we should concentrate is the coordination of national energy policies .
Only if we coordinate our objectives can we make a genuine contribution to global risk prevention .
Then we can work hand in hand and reduce energy consumption through coordinated action .
Nuclear safety policy cannot be included among the priorities .
So we should exclude that area .
After all , we want SYNERGY precisely in order to avoid efficiency losses resulting from overlaps , unclear structures , duplication of work .
As has been said , there have been forerunners to this SYNERGY programme .
It would of course have been useful to evaluate the preceding projects and reports in a consistent manner before formulating this multiannual programme .
Unfortunately that was not done . Since serious efforts were made , however , I nevertheless consider it justified for Parliament to give it the green light .
However , in my view it is quite essential for the annex and table to be incorporated in the programme if we are to approve it .
I would therefore ask the Commission whether it is prepared to support these proposals , which were adopted unanimously in committee .
One of the Liberal Group 's basic principles is that an integrated approach to energy and environment is necessary for a sustainable development of our economy .
The SYNERGY programme may make a contribution here .
CO2 emissions are a cross-border problem and require a European approach .
The eco-tax is an excellent means for that .
Transition to modern technologies will unmistakably contribute to energy efficiency and economy .
Recent research has shown that the Union has a leading position in the field of environmental and non-nuclear energy technologies .
I am also strongly in favour of the Netherlands ' choosing sustainable energy as the central point of its presidency of the Union in 1997 .
Mr President , I believe that the objectives of this programme are excellent .
I thank the rapporteur for his detailed proposals .
I wish we could do them in the European Union . So far as we have seen in our earlier debate on SAVE II , we are not really getting there .
I would like to add one proviso .
I would like to see more emphasis on renewable sources of energy .
There are many applications where renewable energies could be developed in the Mediterranean world and in the Third World .
I would like more emphasis in this kind of report in particular on the great potential for renewable energy , particularly in the solar energy field .
I should also like to say , along with another colleague , that nuclear safety does not belong in such a programme .
We have other programmes devoted to nuclear safety .
I think it would be regrettable to confuse the two .
There are great problems in trying to export nuclear technology to developing countries .
For example , we have not solved the problems of waste .
We , in our group do not support nuclear technology , as you know .
But even at a committee level we cannot start exporting nuclear technology to countries when we cannot guarantee that the waste will properly dealt with .
To say that nuclear safety should be part of this programme - I do not see the logic of it , frankly .
Finally , concerning the rational use of energy and sustainable development , we need to be developing them through fiscal instruments in particular .
I agree with a global approach on this level .
We should follow the Rio agenda .
I would take issue with the REX Committee in saying that the top priority was security of supply within Europe .
The problem and the challenge is much wider than that .
I would commend the approach of looking particularly to the Third World and perhaps pushing the Commission and the Council in that direction , as a very important contribution .
The reason why I think the Third World is so important is , first of all , that it offers the greatest promise for making fairly obvious gains in energy consumption .
Likewise , the Third World often suffers from having very limited resources and limited alternatives because of the poverty of the countries concerned and the revenues available to their governments .
The lesson we have to learn is that the Third World countries should not repeat the mistakes we have already made .
As Mrs Ahern said , we should practice what we preach within the European Union .
I hope that the recent proposal by the Portuguese Foreign Minister to hold regular Euro-African summits can open up opportunities in this area .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I should like to thank Mr Soulier for his marvellous report .
As you know , the actions for international cooperation in the energy sector began in 1988 with budgetary entries at the disposal of the European Parliament .
Initially these covered the provision of assistance for energy planning in countries of Asia , Latin America and the Mediterranean basin .
Later on the same entries were used for countries in central and eastern Europe and of the Commonwealth of Independent States for the development of cooperation on matters of energy policy .
The implementation of actions was characterized by a high degree of flexibility which permitted , for instance , immediate intervention in the autonomous Palestinian territories and , recently , in Sarajevo .
I do not think I need to explain in detail to Parliament why international cooperation in the energy sector is so important .
Mr Soulier has provided a very clear analysis of the objectives of this energy cooperation .
Indeed , Parliament itself has very frequently drawn attention to the value of such cooperation , which , of course , has been a factor in motivating the Commission to develop this proposal .
Mr Soulier has expressed a wish that we now go a step further and institute a dialogue to determine the specific guidelines and priorities for the actions of this programme .
Following the exchanges of view that we have had , we believe that the indicative guidelines and orientations in the annex of the regulation retain the necessary flexibility .
However , Parliament 's legitimate wishes will be taken into account .
The Commission can accept Parliament 's proposal within that framework .
The rapporteur has also requested that the function of the programme with regard to the coordination of structural actions on matters of international cooperation in the energy sector be clearly set out .
We share your anxieties and hence agree with the specific proposals submitted by Parliament .
In addition , the report contains a request that Parliament be regularly informed about the execution of the programme .
We consider that to be a legitimate wish and therefore accept the idea of carrying out a mid-term assessment in addition to that provided for when the programme comes up for renewal .
I must also say that the evaluation of the actions that were developed over the period 1990-1995 - which was carried out by independent experts - reinforces our desire to work from a multiannual basis .
The Commission believes that all of the improvements proposed by the experts must be incorporated in the amended proposal which will include Parliament 's own proposals .
I wish to emphasize yet again the very positive contribution achieved by the rapporteur in presenting such a brilliant report to the plenary .
What the programme does carry provision for , however , is the promotion of training and cooperation seminars on nuclear safety , not on nuclear technology .
I turn now to the amendments . Out of the 27 which are proposed , 24 bring real improvement to the programme and can be accepted .
Given that view , the Commission is unable to accept Amendments Nos 22 and 23 .
The proposed apportionment is at odds with the guidelines set out in the first part of the amendment .
Nevertheless , the Commission will give consideration to the indicative guidelines of the table , and we will pay particular attention to the expressed wish for a higher percentage of actions in Africa .
The Commission considers the table presented by the rapporteur , and , indeed , the original compromise table now being proposed again via Amendment No 27 , to be more suitable .
Mr President , this is not to express my thanks . I simply wish to say that the French version of my text had been curtailed .
The necessary corrective action has been taken as regards my amendment .
Mr Soulier , it is amusing that the version in which there is a mistake is that of your own language . But there seems to be no problem with the other languages .
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Interoperability of the high-speed rail system
Mr President , if I have understood correctly , the Ministers for Transport have recently been doing some soulsearching about the future of goods transport by rail .
It is about time too .
The directive on the interoperability of the trans-European high- speed rail system and its history and content still do not bring that dawn .
Seven years have gone by between the initiative and this second reading .
What is the result of all that ?
Movement backwards , which the often strained relations between the national authorities and the rail companies seem to confirm .
' With the amendments made by the Council to the proposal for a directive the aims sought by the Commission in its original proposals have been drastically altered .
That is the end of the quotation , with my apologies for the involved wording .
That quotation is the Commission 's conclusion which above all stresses once more the wish to take account of users ' needs and expresses regret at the Council 's attitude .
I whole-heartedly agree , Mr President .
I sincerely hope that the approach of the Commission and Parliament will still be apparent in the directive which eventually comes into force .
Anyone who in considering the citizens ' network still thinks in terms of Member States ' frontiers is wide of the mark .
In the long term that is the least possible service to a common European transport policy .
Mr President , I began with transport of goods and I shall end with it .
That amendment aims at least to take account of the opportunities which a European network of high-speed trains may provide for certain forms of goods transport .
I naturally cannot yet see container trains too speeding over that high-speed network .
I should like to say that governing means looking ahead and stagnation means decline , but I have already pointed that out in my brief exposé .
Mr President , I should first like to comment that interoperability does not often attract the interest of the media , the general public or , indeed , many of our own colleagues .
However , it is of vital importance not only to this Parliament but also to the future development of a prosperous , efficient and environmentally-sustainable Europe .
Europe 's rail systems must be compatible .
They must work together .
They must share the same technical standards .
Secondly , we must realize our potential to become more competitive as Europeans and to foster growth and employment .
However , we can only build Europe 's railways for the 21st century if we standardize our national railway systems that were created in the 19th century .
It will cost money .
It will cost millions , perhaps even billions , of ecu over the years to come .
But every ecu spent will be an ecu well spent in terms of the dividends that our economies will secure .
We must look at this as a long-term investment in the future and in the future of Europe 's competitiveness and its ability to tackle environmental problems .
As Mr Castricum has said , we must harmonize the technical standards and , most critically , the standards for users , common ticketing , reservations and information .
This evening I wish to focus on the need for passengers to have easy access to the whole of the European high-speed network . That includes passengers with disabilities .
Marvellous , unless you are a disabled passenger .
Access to the train is only by steps .
A 21st century train using a 19th century concept .
If two disabled passengers travel together they have to sit separately .
If you travel with your family you have to sit apart from them .
It is quite unacceptable that Eurostar should have spent millions of pounds of taxpayers ' money on a European train of the future without adequate disabled access .
It is my contention that we all , as Europeans , will benefit from high-speed trains .
We will all be paying for , and investing in , high-speed trains .
Mr President , I would like on behalf of the EPP Group to welcome the common position and the Castricum report .
The Commission proposals recognize that the existing systems are incompatible and , as a result , engines and railway staff usually have to be exchanged at frontiers .
That is not exactly the sort of exchange and free movement associated with interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system .
We support the common position and its emphasis on the technical compatibility of the national systems .
It is right that technical specifications should be harmonized insofar as this is essential for trans-frontier high-speed transport , while the structure of the national networks is generally to be preserved .
The costs incurred will be borne primarily by the Member States ' railways .
A number of Committee on Transport and Tourism amendments adopted and put to the House today aim to bring the common position closer to the original Commission proposal .
These provisions should ensure that the public will have easy access to the whole network .
With these provisos we recommend and commend the proposal and the Castricum report to the House .
On a personal note , can I just add that I have recently had a medical examination by the European Parliament . My eyesight was pronounced near-perfect .
I challenge anyone in the Chamber , however , other than those of you sitting at the top table , to read the names on the new television screens .
It is absolutely impossible to see one 's name on the screen .
I urge you to bring this to the attention of the authorities so that we can actually see when we are about to be called .
Without it we will not be able to meet the transport needs of the future .
Mr President , it is vitally important for our future that we should change our transport system .
That sounds all very nice , and it is important .
It applies too to the high-speed lines .
Furthermore it is just as important for the systems to be interoperable also in the sense that they become more attractive for the user .
I think I am one of the few Members of Parliament who tries from time to time to travel through Europe by train instead of flying .
Buying tickets is still not so easy .
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of Mr Van der Waal , who cannot he here because he is ill .
The Commission 's proposal on interoperability of the European network for highspeed trains has been drastically altered by the Council .
The reason for this is clear .
With hindsight it is very much to be regretted that European standards were not in force before the construction of the national high-speed networks .
It is to be feared that the Council 's attitude is penny wise , pound foolish .
Moreover a restricted interoperability hinders the desirable liberalization of international passenger transport .
In addition competition between the various railway industries is limited by restricted interoperability .
With the exception of Amendments Nos 5 and 6 I can support the report of the Committee on Transport , which tries to bring the Council 's text back on to the Commission 's lines .
I interpret Amendment No 3 about rapid goods services as transport of express goods such as postal items for which rapid delivery is required .
I can agree with that . I thank the rapporteur for his detailed explanation .
Apart from that there is every reason for adopting measures quickly in order to improve traditional goods transport by rail .
Today 's speeds of some 27 to 37 kilometres an hour must certainly be tripled. in order to avoid having highspeed trains used before long for unsuitable purposes .
Improvement of the logistics of conventional goods transport by rail must thus certainly not be held back .
Those difficulties are apparent if we bear in mind that certain factors - environment , users and management - vary from one country to another .
That is why the Council moved away from the original Commission proposal and , in some respects , Parliament 's amendments .
In short , because of the financial situation of a number of Member States and a number of railway companies interoperability of infrastructure cannot be guaranteed .
It is therefore desirable that interoperability be gradually achieved in relation to transfrontier traffic , the rapid transport of goods and , at a later and none-toodistant stage - the whole of rail transport .
Here there is an implied attitude which is debatable from the point of view of a broad vision of the process of developing the networks and providing services .
To be specific , from a reading of the provisions of this proposal for a directive the lack of interoperability emerges as a fundamental problem as it creates internal frontiers which hinder freedom of movement .
The interoperability of the networks is therefore a question to be solved first. previously .
Once the problem has been expressed in those terms it must be recognized that as long as there is no interoperability there will be no freedom of movement .
But a statement like that is in itself little more than tautology .
And , Mr President , I should not like to end my remarks without congratulating Mr Castricum for his excellent work .
Various problems arise , however , one of them being the cost of such work .
That being the case , how will France , or more precisely the SNCF , be able to finance new infrastructures and rolling stock when it is already heavily in debt ?
The cumulative deficit of the SNCF , which is supported by the State , that is the taxpayer , is FF 175 billion .
In 1995 , the SNCF cost the French taxpayer FF 49 billion , with a deficit of FF 12 billion .
Will the SNCF be in a position to make new investments for the development of an open and competitive market in the high-speed railway sector ?
The Commission favours an almost complete opening up of the high-speed rail network in a single step .
Would it not be preferable to opt for a gradual opening up along the same lines as for air transport ?
Too rigid an application of the law on competition may harm the development of European rail transport , which already suffers from a structural disadvantage in comparison with roads .
To conclude , and on the basis of what I have just said , we should be wary of such an ultracompetitive policy .
That cannot be the right approach in a time of change when for every sensible transport and economic reason , we should think continental .
Obviously , it is contradictory and fanciful to suggest that the interoperable trans-European high-speed rail system which is needed can be achieved without requiring the existing integrity of national networks to be extensively adapted .
That , of course , means the needs of all passengers , including those whose mobility is impaired .
The House is in the debt of Mr Watts who drew specific attention to that issue in the course of this debate .
In particular , I urge Parliament to give backing to Amendments Nos 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 relating to the technical specifications for interoperability .
These technical specifications constitute a new and welcome approach in a directive and they apply the proposed directive 's technical provisions to lay down standards or norms .
The amendments also seek to restore the full force of our original proposal to the environment , operation and user subsystems .
Finally , I particularly commend Amendment No 11 , because it reintroduces the concept of consumer protection as an essential requirement in this proposal .
As Mr Watts said , high-speed train interoperability is hardly an inspirational rallying cry .
So , high-speed train operability will , as high-speed trains become more extensive , enter the main stream of political vocabulary .
I know Mr Castricum and others will welcome that civilized development .
The delays that are encountered can be ended for high-speed train passengers in the near future .
Then we can make further progress by fostering the interoperability of so-called conventional trains .
I am sure that Mr Castricum and other Members of this House will want to be part of that advance .
I welcome their attitude and their effective work and I hope that it is an attitude that is increasingly shared in practice by Member State governments throughout the whole of the Union .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Transport of dangerous goods by rail
Mr President , our Group thinks that strict measures are necessary for the transport of dangerous goods in view of the potential dangers .
That applies also to rail transport , which is relatively safe , but often large quantities are involved and railway lines often run through urban areas .
So we are happy to collaborate in the introduction of a uniform system for transport of dangerous materials for the whole territory of the European Union .
Such a uniform system must guarantee an acceptable level of safety and eliminate existing obstructions to free movement of goods between the Member States in the field of means of transport .
The Council 's common position complies with these requirements and we can therefore support it , but on two points we are not convinced .
The second point concerns informing the competent authorities in advance where transport of extremely dangerous goods is concerned .
That applies also to transport of extremely dangerous goods .
We think that in the event of an unexpected accident involving particularly dangerous transport operations it is important for the competent authorities to be informed about the operations .
I appreciate that it is not easy to lay down practicable criteria for the concept of ' extremely dangerous goods ' .
For that I shall rely on the creativity of Directorate General VII .
Two final remarks .
How does the Commissioner think of applying the concept of ' tunnels with characteristics similar to the Channel Tunnel ' ?
Is it a question of the composition of concrete ?
I can imagine a whole series of ' similar characteristics ' .
What I am concerned about is that the Commission must see to it that this article is not misused to put a spoke in the wheels of the internal market for rail transport .
I understand from a letter which I have just found on the fax that the association of European railway companies is also worried about this .
I should be glad to have a clear answer from the Commissioner on this .
Finally , how does the Commissioner see the development of transport of dangerous goods in the rather longer term ?
Does he expect a considerable further growth of dangerous goods transport ?
If so does he see any reason or opportunity to take action to control it ?
Because we are living in a very densely populated part of the world .
Mr President , this proposal has the very commendable objective of harmonizing safety principles within Member States as regards the transportation of dangerous goods .
These moves are strongly supported by my group .
In its common position the Council has amended both the Commission 's text and Parliament 's opinion .
We believe this could have the effect of putting rail at a disadvantage compared to other modes of transportation .
My group has always been of the opinion that more freight and in particular freight designated as dangerous or hazardous should be moved by rail .
We know that like us the railways themselves favour a harmonized approach based on the RID principles .
In the previous debate we heard about interoperability of highspeed trains .
My group would like to see this interoperability extended to all modes of rail transportation including , more importantly , freight .
However , we still believe that notification of public authorities is important in the pursuit of safety .
The aims are clearly to achieve the highest level of safety and to establish a single market for these transport services within Europe .
We also support the two other amendments , in particular Amendment No 1 calling for the advance warning of the various national authorities in the event of the transportation of extremely dangerous goods .
These two amendments enhance the common position .
We commend these amendments and the common position to the House .
For instance , it has been made compulsory for the Member States to notify the competent authorities so that they can alert the emergency services throughout the territory to be crossed .
The derogations relating to the Channel Tunnel and the transport of extremely dangerous goods such as dioxins and furans are also right and proper .
The proposal is intended to remove existing obstacles to free movement of goods between Member States .
Having the same regime for all transport of dangerous goods obviously adds transparency and clarity for the user and ensures greater safety .
Clearly , the Commission recognises that existing national regimes for the transport of dangerous goods have developed separately and diversely .
We naturally appreciate that harmonization cannot be achieved overnight .
The Council increased the flexibility provided for in our original proposal .
Turning to the amendments before the House today , I have to say that we consider the first to be unnecessarily bureaucratic and it is also impractical .
It requires all rail consignments of what are described as extremely dangerous goods to be subject to a prior notification procedure .
This amendment is therefore unnecessary .
Member States could not accept that existing stricter provisions than the RID would be deleted through this directive .
The unique technical characteristics of the Channel Tunnel and also the Øresund Tunnel , as Miss McIntosh reminded us , were recognized in the Council discussions .
I believe that it is generally the view of Mr Cornelissen and his committee that this is a significant advance .
Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his answer , although he must understand that I do not agree with him in all respects .
Does that mean quite specifically that we must think for example of the tunnel under construction in Denmark and that it will be restricted to that kind of tunnels ?
It does not say ' similar tunnels ' but the directive says ' tunnels with characteristics similar ...
' . That makes us a little dubious .
Mr President , I am happy to respond to Mr Cornelissen .
By their very nature these tunnels are huge pieces of infrastructural development .
By their very nature they must be secure for the purpose of the transport of dangerous goods .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 7.50 p.m. )
Decision on urgency
Madam President , the Committee on Fisheries has agreed to accept urgent procedure and to ask for this to be placed on the agenda for the procedure without debate .
( Parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
The report will therefore be put to the vote on Friday morning .
The deadline for tabling amendments is 12 noon on Wednesday .
Madam President , the Committee on External Economic Relations yesterday unanimously adopted the request for urgency on the report by Mr Pex , as you rightly said .
We hope that the House will do the same .
( Parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
This item is also placed on the agenda for Friday .
The deadline for tabling amendments is 12 noon on Wednesday .
Customs 2000
The aim of the programme is to assimilate and increase the efficiency of customs procedures and customs administration .
Many of the working methods and organizational structures used by the national customs services vary widely and urgently need to be brought more closely into line with each other .
At first reading we adopted a number of amendments to the programme , many of which the Commission has incorporated in its amended proposal .
The Council , however , has made it clear in its unanimously adopted common position that it has different priorities from those of Parliament .
We had a detailed discussion with the Commission and the Council in the committee on whether or not we have Community customs .
In my opinion , this last point is particularly important and could be especially useful in protecting the Community 's financial interests .
The people who will be most affected by this development are freight carriers , who are liable to the customs administration for the proper execution of the transport procedures .
There are huge sums of money involved here , and the carriers are required to provide the customs office with security for their liability .
Cases of fraudulent evasion of customs duties which are discovered by the customs authorities result in enormous penalties for the carriers .
In the Netherlands alone , carriers have had to pay almost ECU 900 million , the situation in Germany being almost as bad .
Individual firms have faced demands for more than DM 50 million , for example , and for many this can spell financial ruin .
In calling for the customs services to be fully computerized as quickly as possible , Parliament therefore hopes to help prevent fraud and protect jobs .
But I should like to place particular emphasis , as most members of the committee sought to do , on the fight against all forms of fraud , and fraud arising out of transit operations in particular .
We stress that sufficient funds should be made available under this programme to enable the declarations of intent to be expressed in action in the field .
Such are the conclusions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and at this point I should like to thank our rapporteur and chairman Mr von Wogau .
I repeat , if we want to be credible we must combat all the many forms of fraud which abound within the Union and which prompt nationalist reactions .
Madam President , a single market needs common protection .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of my group for the great commitment he has shown over a number of weeks while working on this recommendation .
There are two points which I should like to raise .
I think the programme you have proposed will be helpful here , but you will also have to monitor it in practice .
The second point I would like to make concerns a completely different aspect of the programme .
I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has said it is prepared to try to help importers and exporters by considering ways to simplify procedures .
I think that this form of partnership between economic operators and customs authorities is a very good idea and should definitely be followed up .
Madam President , the issue we are again discussing today - in the hope of being able to arrive at a definition of it - is of the greatest importance for the European internal market .
It is very important to define the powers of customs officers , and these have , of necessity to be uniform throughout the Union .
We firmly believe that this proposal may represent a vital step towards the completion of the internal market .
Madam President , the Customs 2000 programme is very important and it is still more important to launch it with realistic objectives .
In this respect Parliament is perhaps attempting to achieve rather overambitious objectives too quickly .
The Greens wish to stress the importance of customs cooperation with third countries and the European Union 's immediate neighbours .
In our opinion at least one-fifth of the Customs 2000 funds should be used to develop those countries ' customs institutions and cooperation with them .
Madam President , both the proposed programme and Mr von Wogau 's report are something of a curate 's egg .
One last point .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , Mr Jarzembowski welcomed the fact that the programme specifically includes economic operators .
If all that happens at the end of the day is that a political decision is taken which cannot be justified in practical terms , then even the most constructive talks are useless .
Nevertheless , we would of course welcome the continuation of talks as part of this programme .
This does not mean , of course , that every lorry has to be unloaded at the border or its destination , which would , as we all know , be quite stupid .
The aim is not to find a scapegoat and hold them responsible for as long as possible .
The aim must be to take deterrent and preventive action , and this is only possible with controls .
Noone was in any doubt about that . And there is no doubt that the romantic symbol of gold stars on the customs officers ' new uniform is going to do anything to solve this problem ...
The measures which must be taken are well and truly enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 .
Will those measures be taken ?
Will there be really any interest among the Member States to take these measures ?
Will not many top officials in various Member States be interested in making sure that there is a certain freedom in terms of fraud so that competition takes place and their products can be sold ?
To what extent can Member States be made responsible for ensuring that provision already taken should actually be executed ?
Madam President , I have only a few brief comments to make on a report whose conclusions I largely support .
This means that the individual Member States should undertake to achieve at least a certain standard of control but that they will be at complete liberty to introduce a stricter system of checks if they so wish .
In the debate in the Committee on Economic Affairs Mr Von Wogau also confirmed that the criteria would be of this minimum nature .
I should like to point out that there is considerable concern in my country that the single market may make it more difficult for us to carry out effective customs to prevent the importation of drugs .
An overwhelming majority of the population want us to be able to step up inspections if we so wish .
For this reason I am also critical of the formulations in Amendment No 3 .
Finally , Madam President , I have my doubts about the value of customs officials ' uniforms bearing the EU logo with the twelve stars .
I therefore regard the twelve stars as a worthless symbol .
I admit , however , that this issue is completely insignificant and it does not affect my positive attitude to Mr Von Wogau 's report .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr von Wogau , for the important work he has done .
As stated in the report , the vital precondition for creating a genuine internal market is that there has to be joint protection of external frontiers .
Those issues will be specifically dealt with , in separate proposals , in a different context .
Nonetheless , the ' Customs 2000 ' programme will provide a framework particularly suited to developing a genuine policy of prevention to combat customs fraud .
And it is in the light of those objectives that the Commission has weighed up the amendments tabled in your draft decision on second reading .
The House proposes incorporating 23 amendments into the common position of the Council - on which the Commission gave its view on 11 January .
Even though the latter amendments cannot be accepted as such , the Commission believes that the ideas underlying some of them reflect objectives endorsed by the Commission .
That being so , the Commission undertakes to include those issues in the work that will be done in implementing this programme .
Thank you , Mr Monti .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Industrial policy for the pharmaceutical sector
Ladies and gentlemen , this report is sure to provoke very widely differing views on the industrial policy we should pursue in the pharmaceutical sector .
I should like to pick up on this point .
Mr Bangemann , we were at the EMEA conference in London together , and I assume that you , as a forward-thinking consumer protector , will also support these demands .
I would like to stress that certain passages in this report have been watered down as a compromise , to ensure that it would receive a majority .
This is , of course , not the ideal way to produce a report , but in the end the wording is always some sort of compromise .
We are also calling for a responsible export policy in the pharmaceutical sector , with the introduction of a code of conduct .
Let me be quite clear about this .
A modern industrial policy must not be geared towards either producers or customers .
It must be geared towards society and its legitimate needs , and above all , Mr Bangemann , it must have the courage to innovate .
In my view , the report should be adopted as it stands .
Madam President , I should like to start where the rapporteur has left off .
We have to recognize , however , that the idea of having an industrial policy for the pharmaceutical industry is rather different from the other industries we have dealt with in the past .
We have to acknowledge that the pharmaceutical industry is intimately linked to health issues and to the national social security systems of our Member States .
When we determine an industrial policy - which we should do for the pharmaceutical sector - we have to recognize that it is a much broader sector than the other industries we have looked at in the past .
At a time when governments are trying to cut their budget deficits , we have to look at the costs involved in buying the pharmaceuticals for the health of our nations .
To ensure that we have healthy citizens we have to ensure that drugs are as inexpensive as possible .
The Socialist Group supports an industrial policy .
Therefore , we welcome the Commission 's proposal to look at the pharmaceutical industry .
There is global competition in this sector .
We recognize that with global markets we have to look at this key industry and ensure that it is competitive within the European Union .
That is why the report we have produced looks at a number of key issues .
We want to encourage innovation .
We want adequate protection of new medicinal products .
We want the availability of medicinal products for citizens throughout the European Union .
But in addition - and we see no contradiction in this - we want the development of an EU-based generic pharmaceutical industry as a positive contribution to competition .
There is no contradiction if we recognize the importance of the pharmaceutical industry for the health of our citizens and for our national social security systems .
So , we want a well-balanced industrial policy but we want to make sure that this balance recognizes the responsibility that the pharmaceutical industry has in Europe .
It has its industrial responsibilities but also a responsibility towards every single citizen that may need to use these products in the future .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission report has been out for two years now , and the House has discussed it in great detail over that period .
This is not the right way to go about things .
We feel that the Commission report paints a relatively accurate picture , but the proposals which it puts forward still need some improvement .
We agree with the Socialist Group 's analysis here .
The most controversial subject in the committee was the issue of generic medicines , on which there was fierce lobbying from the industry .
This is one area where we can actually achieve something , and I think it would be a good way to promote greater transparency and more competition on the market .
There are a number of factors which they have completely overlooked , however .
First and foremost , there is the importance of medical progress .
Research and progress in the pharmaceutical industry depend entirely on having a watertight patent protection period .
Ten to twelve years of exclusive rights are absolutely vital when you know that out of tens of thousands of active substances , only one or two will produce a marketable drug .
Secondly , we must not forget that the market for generics is a purely commercial one and involves only products which are commercially successful .
Thirdly , the comparison with the situation in the United States does not hold water .
The United States does not have price regulation , so the pharmaceutical industry can recover its research costs more quickly .
The solution lies in free pricing , not in cutting down on the patent protection periods .
Finally , the innovative pharmaceutical sector is one of the leading generators of employment .
It has a much greater multiplier effect on other sectors and itself employs 530 000 people in Europe , 80 000 of them highly skilled .
Apart from her desire to reduce the patent protection periods , it is the rapporteur 's views on genetic technology and biotechnology which cause me the greatest anxiety .
I hope that when you vote , ladies and gentlemen , you will put the interests of medical progress and a competitive pharmaceutical industry in Europe first .
Madam President , in relation to this report it is important to emphasise the special nature of the pharmaceutical industrial sector .
It is umbilically linked to public health and , as point E demonstrates , we should first of all aim at the objective of providing the whole population with safe and efficient medicines .
This undeniable priority comes up at Community level against the differences between the health systems and social security regimes in the different Member States and various national peculiarities .
On one hand it is a sector which illustrates in the extreme and with many contradictions the process of private transnationalisation leading to the destruction of national industrial sectors .
The case of Portugal would be a perfect example of this accelerated and perverse evolution which has made the production and trade in medicines completely dependent on the outside .
It is obvious that the pharmaceuticals industry demands huge resources and calls for extremely burdensome research spending .
However it is very important to prevent that research and development from being exclusively at the service of private interests rather than mankind as a whole or public health .
The delicate nature of these questions and the dimension of the interests at stake are both reflected in the report which should deal less with the market and prices .
But that is how things are .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , what we are doing here is developing a European industrial policy for a particular sector .
In the pharmaceutical sector , we need to reconcile a number of different interests .
Secondly , there are the interests of society , since our social security and healthcare systems are greatly affected by price levels in this sector .
Those who have invested in the sector , however , quite legitimately wish to see a return on their capital .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this is a commendable report , despite a rather unfortunate title .
Is not an industrial policy for the pharmaceutical sector reminiscent of the planning we used to see in the iron curtain countries ?
The argumentation without discussion is cast in the same mould .
While it is admittedly impossible to harmonize the management policies in the pharmaceutical sector , there are certain major subjects of concern which this report fails to address .
A specific approach to this problem is essential due to the appearance of new forms of nonepidemiological illnesses .
A medicine exists because it provides treatment , irrespective of whether it is profitable or not .
Japan and the United States have awarded orphan drugs special status .
In Europe there is a legal vacuum in this area .
This question of orphan drugs leads us to the whole matter of public health .
Europe should endeavour to promote this protection of life at all levels , without excluding the so-called risk groups or the victims of rare diseases .
A healthy notion of public health must allow every individual to obtain treatment according to his real needs .
This communication from the Commission seems to be seeking to ascertain how best to restrict the supply of health care .
This is unacceptable .
When you then add to this a failure to understand the market economy , the potion becomes all the more poisonous .
Just one additional question : How do people view the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Hoffmann-Laroche , which is a result of this report ?
Madam President , I wish to record my thanks to the rapporteur for her important work on this key industrial sector in the European Union .
We have no real public health strategy for the European Union , and this is an important omission , which perhaps we can rectify in other pieces of work .
The rapporteur has rightly drawn attention to some of the problems of the sector and particularly to the way in which companies in the United States of America are in many ways making gains .
The area I wish to concentrate on particularly is responsible self-medication .
This leads me on to the important role of the pharmacist in the sale and prescription of over-the-counter medicines .
We need effective labelling , effective and comprehensive testing and pharmaceutical advice if patients are to make a genuine , informed choice about over-the-counter prescriptions .
It is difficult to balance the need for adequate regulation and the safeguarding of patients ' rights .
Now , perhaps that might be more tenuous were we to look at it in a worldwide context .
I welcome the report . I welcome the innovation .
I do not agree that we need a pharmaceutical industry with price controls as they are at the moment , but this is an important contribution to a key-sector policy development .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as a practising pharmacist and someone with research experience in the pharmaceutical industry , there are two points that I should like to make .
The most obvious thing that the medical profession does is to advise patients and help them with self-medication .
The transition of medicines from being prescription-only to being available over the counter must be carefully monitored .
The comparison with the United States , it must be said , simply does not hold water .
Madam President , few reports have been the subject of such intensive lobbying by the industry concerned and I think this is always instructive .
The absence of a free market in pharmaceutical products is regrettable .
But if we need a free market we also need normal patent procedures .
Why cannot we allow , as they do in the United States , companies producing generic medicines to begin their development work in advance of the expiry of patents ?
We know that this work is done for European companies in Turkey and in Iceland , for example .
It is costing us jobs here in the European Union .
There is more than a little hypocrisy among the large pharmaceutical companies , most of which have generic subsidiaries .
They want to hunt with the hounds and to run with the hare .
In the United States they see the generic medicine sector as an important job creator .
This report calls for the opening of that sector .
All of these would lead to a safer , healthier society with more sustainable medicinal practices and a pharmaceutical industry better geared to meet the challenges of the future .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , a large part of our European identity is based on our system of social protection and , in particular , our system of health insurance .
In this respect , Mrs Soltwedel has drawn up a very clear and detailed report which deserves our praise .
Medicines are an essential factor in protecting health .
In this respect we must always remember the importance of information and the essential health safety on which insufficient stress is laid .
Any fudging in this area is to be rejected .
We must impose strict regulations and not leave the market to impose its own rules .
I repeat , it is essential to prevent any backsliding and to establish sufficient health safety not only between the Member States but everywhere .
Let us learn the necessary lessons from the situation caused by the bovine spongiform encephalopathy prion .
We must not limit the action of the public authorities in this field and confine the pharmaceutical sector to the area of industrial policy alone .
There is also the matter of health and people 's lives to be considered .
I repeat , that is what health safety is all about .
As to gentle and homeopathic medicines , these attract me but also leave me sceptical .
Finally , I welcome the creation of the European Medicine Evaluation Agency .
I see this is an excellent first step towards Community regulation .
I should like to end by looking at the need for bioethics and also add that I see Europe 's increasing drug consumption as harmful .
There are countries which stuff themselves with tranquilizers , but I do not know of any pill against misfortune or unemployment .
It calls the attention of governments and of public opinion to the need to create a social climate conducive to therapeutic research .
We cannot support the report presented by the rapporteur . The Group of the European People 's Party has therefore tabled a block of amendments which we think it is essential to approve .
It must not be forgotten that therapeutic progress would be best served by the promotion of innovation as would lightening the future burdens on social security systems .
The best protection of the interests of patients as consumers is the availability of high quality , safe and effective medicines .
We forget that a medicine is an active substance coupled with a process of pharmacological and clinical research , plus information and civil and criminal liability .
Medicines known as ' generic ' , which make no contribution to therapeutic or social progress , contribute nothing to that .
It is only a factor of selfregulation and must be taken as such .
Many of the speeches made by distinguished fellow-Members on this report forget that there is very full legislation in the European Union and that this communication deals only with the perspectives of an industrial pharmaceutical policy .
If we had concentrated on that , perhaps we should have achieved a better result and practically full support for the Commission 's proposals .
Madam President , I too am a small but active minority within the Group of the European People 's Party .
Pharmaceutical research is both costly and time-consuming , and it can take up to ten or twelve years before a new medicine is ready to be put on the market .
In 1993 the average cost of research and development was estimated at ECU 275 million .
And not only are the costs high , there is also a considerable element of risk involved .
All of this means that it is only the really big companies that can spare the money for research and development .
I obviously do not want American patent-holders to carry on benefiting once the patent has expired .
The patent period was the reward we offered the industry under the previous GATT system , in return for its investment in developing new products .
So we need to introduce an exemption in Europe to allow research into generic medicines to start before the patents on them expire .
If the House does not support paragraph 17 , we shall simply be relegating our industry still further down the table .
Madam President , this debate has shown that our communication was very necessary and , in my view , that we still need to discuss this issue further .
A number of questions have been raised here today which need to be examined in detail .
Our communication clearly shows that this is not the case .
The Community 's industrial policy in the pharmaceutical sector needs to take account of both the public health and social security aspects , without undermining the Member States ' powers in this field .
So how anyone could reach the conclusions they have , I do not know , but I have no intention of letting them monopolize our discussions .
What are the problems here ?
In the 1980s , employment in the sector could be expected to grow by more than 2 % a year on average .
Between 1975 and 1979 , 61 % of all new pharmaceuticals were developed in Europe , but the figure dropped to 48 % , in other words to less than half the total , between 1990 and 1994 .
Over the same period , the United States ' share grew from 26 % to 31 % and Japan 's from 11 % to 31 % .
If we include biotechnology , which is of course one of the major fields of innovation and will become particularly important over the next few years , the situation looks even grimmer .
Patents at the clinical and pre-clinical development stage account for 58 % and 48 % of all patents held by American firms , in other words around half .
This is something the communication naturally also deals with - it is , after all , a communication on industrial policy .
But this is not a health report , and health is not one of my responsibilities .
What is more , the Union is not responsible for all health policy matters , and this is a problem I shall come back to later .
The link here is obvious , because the pharmaceutical industry would not exist if it did not work in tandem with the healthcare and in particular the social security systems .
We would seem to be caught in a vicious circle , and it is up to us to find a way out .
The first thing we proposed was to establish a single market in this sector , an idea which has never actually been disputed .
Pharmaceutical products should be subject to the rules of the single market , just as other products are .
This does not mean that they should always be treated like other products .
This was why we visited the Agency .
I also have no objection to involving consumers and other organizations in assessing the results of this procedure and in evaluating medicines and the licences granted .
I have no objection to setting up an ethics committee , Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer .
But if you do , you will have to accept its findings , even if you do not agree with them .
This is not the case here , Mr Langen .
I am a very open person , as you know .
I am even prepared to be friendly , which shows you just how open I am .
What I cannot tolerate , however , is for people to demand an ethics committee and then refuse to accept its findings .
We have an ethics committee on food production and labelling , and I would remind you that it endorsed our views .
We did not ask it to do so , and there was no lobbying .
The members of the committee are completely independent , and they said the Commission was right .
We have already dealt with the self-medication issues .
And - something which is particularly important with new drugs - we have already put in place some of the legal protection called for in this report .
The protection offered by patents can now be extended , in the sense that the unfortunate situation whereby the testing period had to be deducted from the length of the patent no longer exists .
This has already been dealt with , and we do not need to discuss it further .
The USA and Japan have even followed our example .
So we are by no means starting from scratch , and what we have to do now is consider what to do next .
We are left with the four problems that Mr Langen mentioned , which summarize the situation very well .
First of all , which will be more useful : more competition or more regulation ?
I think a combination of the two would work best , both for the industry , for cutting costs , and for consumer supply .
Some regulation will of course be required , and we have no desire to limit the powers of the public authorities here .
We need them to exercise their powers , as is entirely right and proper .
But this too is no guarantee .
Take BSE , for example .
It had nothing to do with competition or the Commission , it was the public authorities who allowed it .
Experience has shown that making a public authority responsible for something is unfortunately not always the best thing to do .
But this does not , of course , mean that we do not need public involvement in this particular field .
This is why I am convinced that experience is best of all .
You only have to look at the second question Mr Langen raised , about generic medicines and self-medication , which Mrs Read also mentioned .
What is the situation here ?
In countries which do not have competitive pricing , such as Spain , Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer , where there are fixed minimum prices for medicines , there are practically no generics at all .
So anyone who wants to bring prices down for the consumer should not run away with the idea that fixed minimum prices are the way to do it .
These are basic market forces , but it is always difficult to have confidence in them , because they seem to be such an artificial mechanism which will inevitably produce bad results .
But this is not what happens .
Mrs Read is right .
Look at how little of the total healthcare budget goes on medicines , for example : 14 % a few years ago , now down to 12 % , and even less in some Member States .
Hospitals account for the largest proportion , and even there the costs have fallen .
So when we are looking at ways of reducing costs , we should also think about how we can make this work better for us .
This brings me on to the question of how what we do affects the social security systems in the Member States .
The Council has not said a word on this , nor will it answer any questions about it , for one simple reason .
You are , of course , aware that any interference in these systems has enormous political implications , and we have absolutely no intention of harmonizing the Member States ' healthcare systems .
What we actually want to do is to remove the price element from the social security system mechanisms and allow it to be determined by the market .
This will produce two results : low , competitive prices and at the same time proper social protection for patients .
If we succeed in doing this - and we have urged the Member States to comply in a special protocol to this communication to the Council - we shall already have achieved a great deal .
Biotechnology is an extremely important issue here , and will come up again when we look at the patentability of technological discoveries .
I hope that we have now made some progress in this field and that Parliament is able to accept the proposal , because there is a very real danger here .
It will not bring us extra jobs either , so what good is such a policy ?
As we can see , biotechnology is really a very important aspect .
Finally , there is the question of generic and herbal medicines .
So do not shoot me , I ' m only the piano player , and I shoot back !
On the subject of generics and patent-protected medicines , here too the best idea is to allow both to exist alongside each other .
Without innovations there would not be any generics , but at the same time generics play an important role in preventing innovations from becoming so prohibitively expensive that the health sector cannot afford them .
There is a symbiosis between the two : they live off each other .
I find it hard to welcome the idea that laboratory testing is to be allowed before the patent period has expired .
A patent covers only some of the costs that can be incurred in research today , which can run to enormous figures .
Someone also pointed out how few medicines have been coming onto the market from research recently .
This is why we need innovations and why they need to be protected .
They can start to compete on price with generics later .
One final comment about mergers , which we also mention in the communication .
Of course the competition rules must apply here .
The biggest pharmaceutical company 's share of the market is just under 10 % .
So even among the largest firms , the spread is so great that there will always be competition .
I hope that I have now answered all the points that were raised in the debate , though I am sure that we shall have a good deal more to say on this subject .
But it is an industry that is losing its competitiveness , and this is what we must take action to prevent .
Before I come back to the pharmaceuticals report , I should just like to put the record straight about BSE .
This does not concern you directly , Mr Bangemann , since it is not one of your responsibilities .
I am delighted to hear this , and I think it will help to provide much greater protection for patients and consumers .
I should like a straight yes or no on this .
I think you owe it to us to make a clear statement on this point , instead of just referring to what Mr Langen said .
My final question will probably also be very important for us .
What follow-up will be given to this communication on the pharmaceutical industry ?
Can we expect directives or other more compulsory measures for the industry in the next six or twelve months , or will there only be the communication for the time being ?
There was no more to it than that .
I did not say anything about the BSE problem as a whole .
Of course we could talk about it for hours , but all I actually said was that the example of BSE shows that this is not always the case .
I think we would get a good deal further if you did not always suspect me of saying one thing and meaning another .
I am very rarely devious , and I always warn you in advance , so that you know when it is coming .
I said this quite clearly and categorically the first time , and now I have said it again .
Naturally a communication such as this is always the basis for further measures .
This will probably be the next item on our agenda , so we shall really want to clarify a few of the points we have mentioned before we produce any further proposals .
There is also the proposal concerning patentability , which I feel is quite important .
Once we have dealt with this , we could discuss what else is necessary .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
Prevention of drug dependence
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for this second reading also we have taken into consideration a number of key factors .
The first is that drug dependence is no longer a marginal issue .
Unfortunately , it is widespread among all social classes and within different ideological groups : it is the scourge of almost all of Europe 's cities - the model cities and those with more rundown districts .
Drug-addicts are not therefore martians : they are , sadly , our children , those who live alongside us .
And if this is our approach to the problem , our starting point , then our response cannot be simple , simplistic , superficial or oversimplified .
What we actually need is to be tough in tackling the problem but also to be willing to talk .
If we are to respond , then we cannot set ourselves apart with our policy or scientific technique - we have to be able to communicate with those working in the field and seeking genuinely to combat drug dependence .
The work with which we , as a committee , tried humbly to make progress is at risk of being undermined .
I want to make that very clear - including to some members of my own group ; I am very much opposed to some of the amendments tabled by the European People 's Party also .
But I most particularly disagree with those in the House who are deliberately trying to undermine a vital piece of work , obeying the diktat of certain governments .
I particularly condemn the superficial approach of those who operate on the basis of hearsay ; those who jump from one report to the next without considering the issues in depth .
We cannot tolerate that kind of destructive and superficial attitude to the tragedy of drug-addicts and their families , this social tragedy .
Of course , if a drug addict becomes a pusher , then it is right and necessary that he should pay and answer before the law also .
To conclude then , Mr President , we say ' no ' to liberalization but , at the same time , no to the criminalization of young drug addicts .
We are engaged in a war in which we should all be fighting because we should all consider ourselves very much involved .
Mr Burtone has succeeded in adopting a pragmatic and realistic approach which studiously avoids the usual platitudes .
However , in recent weeks a great deal of nonsense has been talked about the action plan , and in particular about the report itself .
This is a report on a public health issue and certainly does not come under the third pillar . So let that be an end to all the nonsense .
And what is today 's reality ?
No more than 10 % of the growing supply of drugs is intercepted .
What this means is that drugs are not only still available , they are becoming increasingly available .
Let us come to terms with this hard fact , and stop trying to pretend that we will eventually have a drugs-free society , no matter how attractive the idea may seem .
If we are prepared to accept reality , then we can be much more efficient at every stage of prevention .
Some people think that the police should have a greater role to play .
Let me tell you what Raymond Kendall , the Secretary-General of Interpol , has to say about this .
He is in no doubt that we need to fight drugs , but we are not likely to see any great improvement on the streets , even in the long term .
We should not just invite such people to come to our conferences , we should also act on their advice .
So the results are all extremely welcome .
The main focus is on prevention .
How can you stop young people turning to drugs ?
How can you help addicts to give them up ?
How can you limit the health risks ?
Use European funding for exchanges of experience by all means , but not for specific projects .
We have tabled a number of amendments on this point , and I think it is actually what Mr De Coene himself would like to see .
The policy of tolerance pursued in the Netherlands is not the answer .
It simply makes drugs more easily available and acts as a magnet for addicts from other countries , increasing crime rather than reducing it .
Making addiction a crime also does not work .
We have no sympathy , however , with the fatalistic approach adopted by Mr De Coene , who would have us believe that the fight against those who supply drugs is a lost cause .
Tolerance and liberalization are not the answer , since they lead to a vicious circle in which society has to give more and more ground .
On television in the Netherlands last Sunday a leading socialist , Mr Tobback , said : ' What has our policy in the Netherlands achieved ?
I am the mayor of a city with 35 000 students , and there has not been one single case of a drugs-related death . '
What we in the PPE Group want is for the Commission and the Council to come up with a programme in the near future which takes a close look at the results of Sweden 's anti-drugs policy .
This is the one that our group prefers , and it may turn out to be a viable approach for many other countries in Europe .
Mr President , within every political group in the House there is a majority view and a minority view on the action programme on the prevention of drug dependence .
It is on behalf of the majority of the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party that I should like to congratulate Mr Burtone on his report .
As Mr Burtone said , we are not talking about life on Mars here .
I think it is a pity that the report does not distinguish between hard and soft drugs .
There are also some very welcome calls , such as in Amendment No 23 , for substitute treatments such as methadone to be recognized .
Mr President , I think the basic problem is summed up in a report by Sir Jack Stewart-Clark for the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs .
In that report it is stated that the G7 financial group considers that in Europe and the United States 120 000 million dollars are in circulation bound up with the sale of drugs .
Of that amount 85 000 million dollars are laundered in financial institutions .
I think that is the basic problem confronting all the institutions , including the European Parliament , which try to deal with such a terrible problem as drug dependence .
We agree with Mr Burtone 's report and with the inclusion of the amendments at first reading .
In my country 60 % of prisoners are behind bars because of drug dependence , and 40 % of that 60 % have the AIDS virus .
I know that we do not at present have a majority in Parliament who share this view .
The same would apply to alcohol , if only we resolved to get to grips with the problem .
But I do not want to open up the debate on this issue , given the balance of opinion in the House .
One thing worries me : Europe has seen a debate of incredible stupidity over recent months .
What are we heading for ?
This really is a bit much to take , ...
This is why our Parliament must adopt the Burtone report .
I do not agree with everything in it , but it is better than many other things .
Mr Chirac is a veritable danger to the public when it comes to public health and drugs .
But he will learn as he gets older , he will come to understand , as everybody does .
This is the edifying net result of the policy of repression .
But yet I do not propose to counter the dogma of unprincipled repression with a dogma of liberalization lacking in any public health objectives .
This is a simple , clear and understandable policy .
As long as we fail to courageously advance along this path , crime will continue to prosper from individual tragedies .
Mr President , we have now almost finalized the drugs prevention programme .
The common position contains a considerable number of qualitative improvements introduced as a result of amendments proposed by Parliament .
It will be easier to allocate funding now that specific projects are planned , which will help both the Commission and the Member States .
But this is playing into the hands of the drugs dealers , who are indirectly responsible for the destruction of their fellow men .
I therefore also oppose the amendments which aim to have harm-reduction adopted as a strategy .
Persuading addicts to kick their drugs habit is a very delicate issue and cannot be governed by any general European strategy .
It is also a curative rather than a preventive measure , and this is not what this action programme is about .
To sum up , I support the common position , but I shall be voting against the Burtone recommendation .
I therefore request , as far as possible and in Parliament 's interest , the removal of these documents which are posted up all over the place .
Now for the real subject of discussion . I know that the rapporteur had a difficult task to the extent that , right from the start , the distinction between prevention and repression seems rather artificial .
Repression is clearly in many cases the best form of prevention .
And I did indeed say ' limit ' .
I should like to take an example in the field of economic sciences , namely inflation .
Under the pretext that zero inflation is virtually inachievable in a period of economic growth , some economists have always believed that the official policy should be one of low inflation .
As in the case of inflation , and for evident psychological reasons , I believe this to be a mistake .
Today it has been made very clear to us that if we want to effectively combat inflation our goal must be zero inflation .
The situation is very similar when we come to drugs .
We must clearly affirm our commitment to combatting them .
Another mistake is the way Amendment No 4 , for example , suggests that drug addicts are simply people with a health problem .
This is not true : there is indeed a health problem , but also a moral problem and we should not forget this .
On the contrary , I believe this would be presenting them with an additional obstacle when seeking to escape from drugs .
The human mind is not entirely rational , as we now know thanks to the work of phrenologists such as Mac Lean , and collective repression is absolutely essential .
It serves no purpose to spend large sums of money if you lack the moral courage .
You have been very courageous Mr Burtone .
You have , through your group , encountered many obstacles .
I have been well aware that you had to steer a course between the two extremes .
It is essential to speak of risk prevention .
But it is not enough .
The Lisbon Observatory provides us with the tragic figures .
Of course there have been arrests and of course drugs have been seized , but drugs are continuing to enter Europe in ever larger quantities every year .
The least we can say without making a moral judgment is that the repressive policy is not working .
But that does not mean I favour simply opening up the gates , quite the contrary .
However , I do not believe you are going to get very far by giving equally short shrift to those who want to liberalize and those who simply want to repress .
I greatly admire your courage and this report , but it is not enough .
Let us be quite clear : there is racism in drugs .
When I hear of the tragic effects of soft drugs , I think of alcohol and tobacco .
For these are our drugs .
Tobacco leads to a dependence estimated at 25 or 35 % .
And what do you do about that ?
But then it 's the State which sells it .
I am speaking from the public health point of view , if you like , but also from a moral and political point of view .
It is tobacco and alcohol which cause most damage in terms of public health .
Let us remember this and not demonize other people 's drugs .
We too have our drugs .
What is needed is an economic approach .
We must have the courage to say that we must control , and not simply decriminalize drug use .
Just as if you have drunk too much you are not allowed to drive , so if you smoke too much you will not be allowed to drive .
But when you consider that , in my country in particular , there are five million cannabis users , I wonder how we are going to manage to lock them all up .
Here in Parliament we have the obligation to discuss this matter a great deal more .
We clash with the experience of others rather than listening to it .
We should therefore discuss more among ourselves and benefit from national experiences , both negative and positive .
I believe that this will be progress and that this conference which you mention and which we all want to see , in 1996 , will be a step in the right direction .
Finally , we must not demonize any experience or initiative , whether negative or positive .
Mr President , drugs are a scourge which destroy our families and kill our young people .
For very many years already the European Parliament has concentrated on three courses of action in combatting this tragedy .
Firstly , preventing drug addiction , secondly , combatting drug trafficking and the related crime and , thirdly , helping drug addicts to get well again .
Today we are interested in the first of these courses of action .
In my eyes this is the most important .
But above all we must help parents who are so often ill-equipped to confront the dangers threatening their children , and also the teachers and trainers , especially those active in risk environments .
Finally , let us remember one important principle : programmes undertaken with young people are often far more effective than those undertaken for young people .
I believe that creating a sense of responsibility among those primarily concerned and ensuring their active participation must be a golden rule in preventing drug addiction .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I congratulate Mr Burtone for the efforts he has made , particularly of late , to tackle the problem with greater clarity but also greater realism .
Understanding at last that punishment is not the solution to the drugs problem seems to me to be in itself an important step forward , as is the fact that the preventive approach is being adopted .
That then is the reality .
We need then radically to change our approach and we must do this all together , to start with by discussing among ourselves the results so far of prohibition and criminalization .
That is why the most important amendment is Amendment No 32 which calls for a conference to be held to discuss scientifically the disastrous results of prohibition and for the international conventions of the United Nations to be revised .
Mr President , Mr Burtone has done some wonderful work and he is obviously very concerned about drugs but at the same time I would like to say that I do not share all his views .
In our group I speak for something that we call the minority but I in fact believe that in this case the minority is bigger than the majority .
It is completely mistaken to regard a restrictive policy on all drugs as the antithesis of a policy to reduce suffering and the harmful effects of drug abuse .
Unfortunately , however , this type of decision helps to undermine the legitimacy of the European Parliament and the confidence of the people of Europe in it . This is an unfortunate consequence of today 's debate .
This debate has also strengthened still further my conviction that the area of criminal law should remain a purely national concern for the Member States .
The report also contains demands for a supranational drugs policy and for a review of existing international conventions .
The policy of certain EU countries in the field of drugs today in practice serves to sabotage international cooperation in the fight against drugs .
In the report the issue of drugs is treated as a health issue and dependency as an illness . Drugs are , however , primarily a social and political issue .
The reasons for drug abuse are social conditions , exclusion , unemployment and the lack of future prospects for young people .
The battle against unemployment , social injustice and segregation is thus an important part of the battle against drug abuse - the most important part .
A proper policy for a system of care and rehabilitation which works is also needed .
In this context it is also impossible for society to accept either trafficking in or the possession of drugs - they should be illegal .
There should also be popular opposition to drugs and steadfast and consistent action on the part of the police and customs authorities .
This policy forms a single whole , all parts of which are needed .
This is why I would like to see a consistent overall policy with a single goal : a drug-free society .
Mr President , it is customary to congratulate a rapporteur .
This report goes against prevailing opinions and the blindness which make a situation which is in itself extremely worrying worse by the day .
So today we are concerned with the question of prevention .
This prevention must clearly be applied to hard drugs in particular , concentrating on intravenous drugs .
All of these elements must be appraised .
In this respect , holding a conference which would call into question the position of the international community would be very welcome .
This is a task which places us under an obligation and demands that we , as parliamentarians , accept our responsibilities and do not simply let things rest .
The view expressed by Mr Burtone 's report is a view which worries me .
It smacks of resignation and lack of enthusiasm .
Its message is that the battle against drugs cannot be won - but this is not true .
We know that a restrictive drugs policy combined with a well-developed rehabilitation system produces results .
We know that the fewer the young people who try drugs in the first place , the smaller the number who will become addicted .
This is why preventive work is aimed at young people .
It is by far the most important thing we can do .
It is the most important way of reducing the number of addicts in the future .
A policy which is geared only to reducing the damaging effects of drug abuse which is already taking place sends out completely the wrong signals and devotes resources to a completely wrong objective .
The policy of harm reduction is a policy of negative accommodation . It is a defeatist policy .
If we are to be successful in combating drug abuse we cannot make distinctions between use and misuse .
Nor can we make distinctions between soft and hard drugs .
There is always a risk - irrespective of what we choose to call it - an imminent risk that individuals will become addicted .
I cannot therefore support the Burtone report and I hope that this house will be able to produce a more positive and more active policy on drugs .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by thanking Mr Burtone for his report .
Hopefully , effective addiction prevention measures will succeed in reducing the demand , as they have done in the case of heroin .
I should also like to voice my opposition to any liberalization of drugs , in order to counter the expectation of rising demand .
Europe is still seen as a lucrative market where there are profits to be made .
At the same time , any tendency towards liberalization and legalization has the effect of playing down the dangers of illegal drugs and is the greatest obstacle to prevention .
Reference is always made in these debates to the consequences of alcohol and nicotine abuse .
Not only should these problems be mentioned , but they should be seen as a clear warning , so that we do not end up with the same problems by making soft drugs freely available .
We need to offer improved and more specific counselling and treatment for those who are in danger from , or dependent on , drugs , and their families .
Let us support the concept of living without drugs or addictive substances , and let us not trivialize these problems by engaging in a debate that blurs the issues .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased that the action programme on drug dependence is the subject of discussion in the House today .
90 % of the addicts being treated in my region are under 30 years of age .
We must turn off the tap and stop the continuous supply .
Naturally , we must also improve and reinforce treatment programmes .
I welcome the proposals of the common position of the Council which include a series of schemes which are clearly more important and more specific than those of the Commission 's initial proposal .
Efforts must continue in this direction .
In particular , we must increase the resources allocated to treatment cures .
We must also promote improved cooperation between Member States and between the competent Community bodies in this field .
And would it not also be wise to bring together all the Community bodies and agencies active in this area within a single organization ?
It is only by such a pooling of energies that we will be able to effectively combat and eliminate this scourge .
Mr President , it is most welcome that we now have our first preventative drugs programme based on health and social considerations .
I hope this is the beginning of better cooperation between the police and home affairs authorities on the one hand and the health and social authorities on the other .
There is a need for cooperation projects between the different authorities .
In Finland we have had experience of these problems mainly owing to the import of drugs across our Eastern border .
The starting point of drugs policy must be clear : society does not approve of drugs .
The non-medical use of drugs is unacceptable .
' Legal drugs ' ( tranquillizers ) finding their way on to an illegal market , especially when used in combination with alcohol , are a major and serious problem particularly for young people .
Controls must be tightened .
Drug education must be carried out skilfully and expertly without shock tactics and together with young people .
Further research is also needed .
Mr President , I strongly agree with the proposals contained in this report .
For too long in Europe we have been concentrating on financial and trade issues at the expense of major social issues such as the drugs problem .
The imbalance has been somewhat redressed by the public health competence given to us by the Maastricht Treaty .
Combined with unemployment and poverty , drugs are laying waste large parts of our cities and destroying the lives of our young people .
We need , for instance , to increase the size of the Drugs Squad .
The Drugs Squad in Ireland stands at 1 % of the total force . That is laughable when 80 % of Dublin crime is drug related .
We must also ask for effective coordination between the Gárdai , the revenue commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare .
It is time that the government came to grips with any remaining industrial relations problems in this area so that the ill-gotten gains of the drug dealers can be targeted .
I visited Mountjoy Prison recently in Dublin .
It is clear to me that a policy of ' containment only ' operates there .
An effective follow-on therapy should be provided for prisoners by the Eastern Health Board .
The Ecstasy problem is now escalating out of control and party packs are now widely available in Dublin .
We need more education programmes .
I ask the Commission to bring forward further programmes along these lines to tackle this life-threatening problem that faces all of Europe .
Mr President , I have been working on the issue of drugs since the very first committee of inquiry in which I served with Sir Jack StewartClark .
I found myself pulled in a variety of ways over the years .
Very often it is ageing liberals from the ' 60s , like myself , who advocate liberalization , legalization of drugs .
They make a very good case very often .
Of course the element of unemployment and poverty is very significant here .
We need to pay particular attention to our prisons .
Contrary to what has been said by the previous speaker , I am happy to tell you that a specialized unit has been opened in the prisons in Dublin .
I am sure many colleagues from other countries have experienced the same problem that very often young people in prison , who may not in fact be addicted when they go in , come out addicted .
Therefore it is important that one has a unit in prisons where the prisoners themselves can make a choice against drugs .
You will find that a significant number of them will probably make that choice .
While 80 % of the people in our own prisons are there because of drug-connected crime , some of them are not .
This is a contagious disease , as contagious as tuberculosis was in the ' 40s and ' 50s .
We have to treat it like that .
We also have to recognize that our detox and treatment programmes must include not just detox but also an element of teaching life-skills .
You cannot rehabilitate people if many of them have never been habilitated in the first place .
Mr President , I know that Commissioner Flynn shares with us the regret that we do not have total competence in all matters concerned with drugs .
The fact that law and order sits within the third pillar is regrettable .
Therefore , this common position is a good first step .
Mr Burtone has made a sympathetic report and , on the whole , we ought to support this .
My view is that national countries must decide on their own drugs policy .
Indeed , if we look at my own country , in Scotland and England there are two separate drugs policies .
Scotland is more concerned with harm reduction than England . And here I see an absolutely vital role for the Drugs Monitoring Centre .
That is its value .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the health of the people of the Union is something we concern ourselves with as regards foodstuffs and consumer goods .
Why should we then not concern ourselves with the health of our fellow citizens where drug abuse and its effects on the brain , lungs and reproductive organs is concerned ?
The policy on drugs must be approached from different angles .
There are no simple solutions .
The goal must be a society free of drugs .
We must find common and national methods which are effective .
The emphasis here must be on prevention and combating drug trafficking , while treatment detection and prosecution are national responsibilities .
If we wish to have the support of the people we cannot use EU resources to finance controversial projects , such as the prescription of heroin .
Syringe programmes involving methadon are also controversial , however .
5 % of those who participated in methadon programmes over a period of ten years managed to overcome their addiction - this is not particularly effective .
We should , however , jointly evaluate our special national programmes .
This will also enable us to find a common policy , which will emerge from the results , results which will of course lead to lower demand .
The alternative to this policy is increasing drug abuse and gains for the drug traffickers .
What is important now is to show a willingness to compromise . This we must do if we are to be able to achieve common measures .
It is not the drug traffickers but our colleagues in the European Institutions that we should support .
Every time drugs are discussed in the European Union , tempers flare - this time between France and the Netherlands .
I am alarmed at how all the protagonists in the debate portray their own opinion as the only legitimate one .
This is an accusation often levelled at Mr Chirac , but in my experience it is at least as true of those , within and outside this House , who make a fetish of liberalization .
As far as the PPE Group is concerned , the contradiction that is often drawn between help and punishment does not exist .
Both are necessary if the problem is to be tackled truly effectively .
The Swedish model seems to me the most successful one at present .
In the light of that , I am also irritated by the debate between my country - Germany - and the Netherlands .
I wonder whether Mr Kinkel has forgotten that we are in the third year after Maastricht .
The dialogue about combating drugs is not interference : it is European domestic policy .
To my mind , the third point is of particular importance .
Mr President , I first of all thank all those who have contributed in such a sincere and dedicated way .
Obviously it is a debate that touches a lot of people 's concerns in the House .
The text before you today for this second reading is the Council 's common position on the first programme for Community action to prevent drug dependence .
We all agree on the need for such a programme and the need to adopt concrete measures to combat drug abuse at European level .
As you know , the initial proposal has been extended following the incorporation of some 21 amendments which were proposed by Parliament and which were supported by the Commission either fully or partially .
The Council took on board many of the amendments , sometimes , I have to say , in a different form .
I believe that considerable progress has been made in arriving at a text which is acceptable to all the Community institutions .
I accept that there is need for some further work to be done so that we can resolve the differences that exist .
For its part the Commission could not accept the Council 's common position for two principal reasons . They have both been referred to here .
The Council wants to reduce the overall budget for the five-year programme from ECU 28.5m to ECU 27m .
The Commission finds this unacceptable given that the common position which has been suggested by the Council substantially extends the scope of the original proposal .
It wants to extend the scope and still reduce the money .
We find that unacceptable .
Secondly , the management committee , a structure which is proposed by the Council , is inappropriate for such a very small-sized programme .
The Commission supports the setting up of a purely advisory committee , both as a matter of principle and in order to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens .
I remain of that view , notwithstanding the decisions taken on the committee structure for the three other health programmes recently approved under the codecision procedure .
I would like to turn to the Commission 's position on the 32 amendments proposed by the rapporteur in the second reading .
Twelve are acceptable to the Commission , Mr Burtone , fully or in part .
These are Nos 3 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 26 , 27 , 28 and 31 .
On the remaining amendments the Commission cannot support the draft recommendations for the following reasons : Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 8 , 11 , 14 and 30 and the new Amendments Nos 33 to 36 .
Amendment No 4 : this statement is already covered by recital 1 of the common position and by Amendment No 6 .
Amendment No 5 : Amendment No 7 describes the objectives of the programme in greater detail without reference to the objectives of a policy on drugs .
Amendment No 9 is already covered by Amendment No 7 .
Amendment No 13 : the content of this amendment is covered by Amendment No 15 which is acceptable to the Commission .
Amendment No 18 : the tasks of the EMCDDA are dealt with in the regulation establishing it and it cannot be modified through this programme .
Amendments Nos 19 , 20 and 21 : I have already underlined the Commission 's position concerning the nature of the committee foreseen by Article 5 of the proposed decision .
Furthermore , I would like to point out that Amendments Nos 19 and 21 are not in the line with the decisions taken by the three health programmes that were adopted at the beginning of this year .
Amendments Nos 22 and 37 : the activities foreseen in these amendments are not in line with the principle of subsidiarity and would exceed the budgetary possibilities of the programme .
Amendment No 23 : the Commission was supportive of the evaluation and exchange of experience in the fields mentioned in the amendment and this has been incorporated into the common position .
Amendment No 24 : the Commission considered that these activities are already included in the common position under generic provisions .
I hope that the adoption of this programme will in due course support , relaunch and act as a catalyst for common efforts to prevent drug dependence and to help drug users .
Mr President , I wish to speak briefly to express , certainly , my appreciation for the efforts made by the Commissioner to align the Commission position and that of the House .
But significant differences remain , both with the Commission and with those who have tabled amendments on behalf , among others , of the EPP , the effect of which is to distort the work done so far .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Votes
Madam President , we would like a separate vote on Amendments Nos 5 and 6 .
Madam President , I was under the impression that we had agreed that if we wanted a separate vote on anything , we had to say so in advance .
I naturally agree with Mr Pompidou , but I think we have to be consistent , otherwise we cannot carry on .
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , you are perfectly right in the case when there is a recommendation from the committee responsible .
That is why I initially stated that there had not been any recommendation from the committee responsible in the case of these amendments .
There is not therefore any problem .
Excuse me for intervening once again , Madam President , but we also want a separate vote on Amendments Nos 22 and 23 .
( The President declared the common position adopted as amended )
I should like a separate vote on Amendment No 16 , Madam President .
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , on this occasion the committee responsible has recommended a block vote on Amendments Nos 12 , 16 , 19 , 21 .
Furthermore , your request for a separate vote does not seem to have reached us before the deadline laid down by Rule 116 .
I am sure you will understand the difficult situation this puts me in .
We did everything according to the rules , Madam President .
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , as you were able to appreciate this morning , we are introducing a system which is , let us say , rather more constraining and rigid than we are used to .
This is why I am going to allow a separate vote on Amendment No 16 .
When you are President Mr Anastassopoulos , you will be perfectly free to be as inflexible as you like .
For the sake of fairness , Madam President , if we have a sperate vote on Amendment No 16 , we request the same for Amendments Nos 19 and 21 .
Mr Pompidou , you are seeking to shamelessly profit from the situation !
No , Madam President , it is in the interests of consistency .
I am sure , Mr Pompidou , that you will withdraw this request which was made in order to inject a little humour into the vote .
No , Madam President , my group is with me .
I cannot decide alone to withdraw this request .
( The President declared the common position adopted as amended )
But I should like to draw attention to the fact that having approved the previous text we will be contradicting ourselves if we do not adopt the amendment which I propose .
Yesterday Commissioner Papoutsis , who was here , demonstrated the coherence between the text we have just adopted and the table I propose .
This is why I invite you to vote in favour of my amendment , especially as the Commission and Parliament must succeed in convincing the Council .
Madam President , I should like to support the amendment .
I do not think there is any contradiction here .
The committee approved the table unanimously because , in the table , priorities are established very clearly , perhaps more clearly than in the broader brush-strokes of the text .
As I said , however , there is no contradiction here , and the committee approved this table unanimously .
Thank you sir .
The House is sufficiently well-informed to vote in full knowledge of the facts .
After the adoption of the ' table ' part of Amendment No 27 :
Madam President , the table I referred to was , of course , that of the committee , not the table submitted by Mr Soulier and the PPE .
It is really quite straightforward , because the committee presented and approved this table , not the one that was submitted by the PPE .
I would therefore ask that the vote be retaken , because what I said clearly created some confusion .
So to recap and to make it quite clear : the committee 's table is not the same as that of the PPE .
Mr Lange , I believe that there is in effect some confusion .
I believe that for my part I have been very clear .
I put to the vote Amendment No 27 by the European People 's Party .
The rapporteur then requested to speak in order to explain why he was in favour of this amendment and why he had tabled it .
You spoke giving the impression that you supported it , but that is your affair .
This amendment was put to the vote once again and I made it quite clear which one we were dealing with .
We will not be taking this vote again .
That would not be right .
I believe that everything was very clear .
I should like to protest .
It is indeed normal for a rapporteur to speak on behalf of the committee .
But in this case we were misled for the simple reason that the rapporteur did not speak on behalf of his committee , but on behalf of his group .
That is not at all normal .
I most definitely did not hear Mr Soulier refer to the PPE Group .
I was really very attentive and I tell you this quite simply .
We will not be taking this vote again , it would not be right to do so .
Everything was very clear .
I should simply like to say this , Madam President .
On this basis , it was therefore preferable to support Amendment No 27 by Mr Soulier rather than to maintain Amendment No 26 by our Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy .
I assure members of my group that everything was conducted properly .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
There has been no movement on the THERMIE programme , a programme on renewable energy , which is being held up by the Council .
Despite its high-sounding political pronouncements around the world , and despite having signed up to the Rio and Berlin treaties , the Council is blocking the one programme - THERMIE II - which is concerned with renewable energy .
It is therefore all the more important that we , as a Parliament , get it implemented and make the Council and the Commission put their money where their mouth is .
Otherwise , we in the EU will gradually become a laughing stock !
I would not go so far as to call us liars , but absolutely nothing is happening !
High-sounding words about the need for energy efficiency and CO2 reduction are being bandied about , but nothing is being done !
It is all hot air .
That is why the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy included the legislative element in SAVE II .
So , to repeat my advice to the Council and the Commission : take your lead from the committee - it is giving you sound advice !
Otherwise , we shall make problems when it comes to the budget .
It is vital , therefore , to extend the SAVE programme for a new five-year period with a view to a more rational use of our scarce resources .
There is no point in not legislating in this area - on grounds of the principle of subsidiarity - in view of the cross-border nature of the problems associated with CO2 .
Recommendation for second reading by Mr von Wogau
We assume that the Customs 2000 programme is concerned with agreeing at Community level criteria for the minimum level of the controls to be carried out .
In our opinion each Member State should itself be allowed to decide on the level of controls to be carried out at its borders with other EU countries .
We are therefore very pleased today , at second reading , to see that the Council has since taken the same line as ourselves and rejected Parliament 's most contestable amendments .
As could have been expected , the European Parliament has returned to the attack with amendments which my group voted against .
Now , under the pretext of improving external controls , the proposal is to move towards ' communitization ' . This is to make another mistake , and for three reasons .
I approve of Parliament 's insistence in giving the Community ' Customs 2000 ' programme more force and substance faced with the hesitations of the co-legislator , the Council .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy thus wants to step up the fight against fraud through harmonized and reinforced customs .
In the face of third parties , common tariffs must be matched with common customs .
This means imposing strict rules everywhere where there are customs , and not rules which vary from one Member State to another .
Such a programme can encourage the European Union to advance in this direction , but we must of course show we are serious in implementing the programme , in particular when it comes to the controls .
Each Member State must provide its customs with the technical and human resources necessary to fulfill this task .
I stress in particular the importance of continuing high-level training supplementing the initial training which each customs officer receives in his country of origin .
This continuing training , to be given at a European customs academy , will be a vital asset for European customs officers working at external borders and involved in the fight against fraud .
We have voted today against almost all the amendments to the Community action programme ' Customs 2000 ' , since we believe that they do not respect the individual Member States ' sovereignty .
It should still be up to each Member State to decide how they wish to control their borders , train their personnel , etc .
Obviously preventive activities must be combined with a well-developed system of rehabilitation , the main concern of which should be to free those involved in drug abuse of their addiction and to help their return to society .
The problem of where the line should be drawn will always arise and any ambiguity about what is acceptable and what is not will only send mixed signals to our children and young people .
The Council must accept the cooperation which must be implemented . The Council must see drug addicts as people in distress who must be brought back into society and not as delinquents .
However it is precisely prevention of , as opposed to combating , this serious problem which is best undertaken at national state level .
The states themselves are best able to assess which policy and what resources in their particular circumstances - including cultural norms - will produce optimal results .
The consumption of various kinds of drugs , including so-called hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine , has assumed dramatic proportions over the last 20 years .
It is not surprising therefore that many EU citizens today regard drug abuse as one of the greatest of all social problems .
Nor can there be any doubt that this cross-border problem must , and will , be solved by means of a combination of national and international measures .
In this light there is every reason to welcome the Commission 's proposal for a programme of action for the prevention of drug abuse .
I fully support these proposals to improve the Community 's programme of action .
Recommendation for second reading by Mr Castricum
The proposed interoperability of the transEuropean high-speed rail system is a good project .
But it only has any meaning if it is accompanied by a financial plan allowing Europe to complete the efforts made by the individual Member States .
We must apply the principle of subsidiarity and too often the European Union intervenes illegitimately in matters which are normally within the sphere of competence of the Member States .
But in this particular case it is surprising that the European Union is not pledging major financial support for this ultimate transborder project .
Thirdly , we are highly suspicious of the praise of self-medication . This opens the door to all kinds of abuses and dangers .
The most important consideration in all of this must be public health .
The European Union 's interest , and particularly that of the European Parliament , lies in both the industrial and public health aspects .
That concludes voting time .
Mr President , I did not quite understand why the order of the reports was changed . I was told that the President-in-Office would attend our debate and hear at least the first reports .
I would greatly appreciate your confirmation on this point . My fear is that we will waste time by making further changes and failing to adhere to the agreed timetable .
Mr President , following on from the question that Mrs Theato has raised , the Council itself fixed the time for the trialogue .
So it has deliberately double-booked itself . To be in another room having the trialogue while the debate on discharge is taking place in this House is unacceptable conduct .
It determined when it was going to be . It decided that in this debate , which rests on its recommendation , it can waltz in here whenever it wants and make its speech without having heard the debate .
I hope therefore , Mr President , that you will consider denying the floor to the Council when it arrives , because it has treated this House with disdain and contempt . We should show it the same .
I have been an elected representative for 25 years , but I have never experienced anything like this . Will you arrange for a representative of the Commission to come here without delay ?
It is quite impossible to proceed with the discharge debate under these circumstances .
I was just going to make the move for adjournment and I am supported by a large number of Members from all round the House .
The way it has tried to conduct the meeting during the last two hours has been an absolute disgrace . I cannot see an end to it within the next two hours .
Mr Wynn , ladies and gentlemen , I shall suspend the sitting for ten minutes .
I have sent someone to ask whether after these ten minutes we can expect the Council and the Commission .
( The sitting was suspended at 3.10 p.m. and resumed at 3.20 p.m. )
The Commissioner has been kind enough to come straight away .
Mr President , I warn in advance that God help the Council if it comes in here wanting to lecture us for half an hour on a debate it has not heard .
I therefore call upon the rapporteur , Mrs Kjer Hansen , to present her report .
I hope that message will be an important consideration in any discussion of future agricultural policy .
It is also a problem that agricultural expenditure is paid via the EU budget only . Naturally , the Member States do not , therefore , have the same interest in exposing irregular payments which may have taken place .
It is quite simply a clash of interests between the Commission and the Member States in that expenditure is not shared .
The procedure for closing the accounts is far from satisfactory for several reasons . The Commission does not have sufficient resources to carry out the procedure satisfactorily .
Of course , both good and bad things might be said about such negotiations , but the fact is that there is no question of objectivity .
Of course there are other Member States which find this so-called flexibility quite acceptable , because they believe it could be in their interests .
The problem is , however , that the idea behind the closure of the accounts is to recover expenditure not actually entitled to support .
The system suffers from numerous failings and the most serious is that it does not ensure , and does not seek to ensure , objectivity in closing the accounts , so that the amounts recovered reflect actual losses .
Then there was the milk quota buy-back scheme which was being operated without any legal basis .
This is an extremely serious matter .
It means that the Commission makes the application of the Treaty and the principle of equal treatment conditional on a protest from one or more of the Member States .
I realize that most of these decisions were taken by the previous Commission , but I insist on having a clear explanation from the present one .
I know that the Commission is to make a statement tomorrow , but perhaps the Commissioner responsible for the budget and budget control could say something now about this ' spend , spend , spend ' approach .
I think this is an extremely serious matter which undermines the credibility of the entire Commission .
Can the Commissioner explain how this is supposed to be consistent with the strict financial management which Mr Santer announced , and on which I congratulated him ?
I was preparing to follow Mr Wynn with my remarks and now I find that I am playing St John before him !
The Court devoted considerable resources to the DAS ( Statement of Assurance ) and that fact is obvious when you see the shortcomings or look for the holes in the Annual Report for 1994 .
I look to the new President of the Court to bring about a restructuring of the working methods of the Court .
The second problem follows the receipt of the DAS by the European Parliament .
This has led to considerable discussion in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
I strongly support the answers provided by Mr Wynn , which he will give later and which can be found in his explanatory statement .
It did not say how the Court should do it and it did not say what we should do with it .
Now my friend Mr Blak has had to depart . It is a matter of breaking the windows and running away .
Last year I said about him ' I regard him as the man in charge of the European Coal and Steel Community .
He does a splendid job . ' However , with his remarks about the closure of coalmines , he has allowed his party politics to get the better of his normally sound judgment .
He is at it again this year ! It is true to say that he makes it clear the United Kingdom has not acted illegally .
There has been no question of deliberate wastage of European Coal and Steel Community funds .
The Commission did not help because it indulged in some appalling labour relations so that more than half of the staff were not prepared to move .
I do not think Parliament helped either because we had asked for independent consultants to come in and review the work of CEDEFOP .
They chose to come in just at the time when morale was under the floorboards because the staff were not happy with the arrangements that were being made .
The Court produced a fairly critical report on this point , but the consultants went so far as to suggest that the centre was not a great deal of use to the Community .
I do not think the Committee on Budgetary Control is the right body to make a qualitative assessment as to the centre 's usefulness and future use .
That is the work for the Spending Committee .
My view is that as long as there is a growing demand for the centre 's reports they must be doing some useful research which people want to get hold of . That is a good commercial justification .
That work deserves an even higher priority .
Rather than condemn CEDEFOP out of hand by refusing discharge , we propose that discharge should be deferred .
I finish with an appeal to the Commission and everybody else concerned to look at what is happening to the management boards for both Dublin and Thessaloniki .
There are now more people on the management boards than there are people working in the centre .
The founding fathers ' original idea was to get the social partners to talk together - that is a good thing - government , employers and trade unions .
They meet twice and their bureau meets three or four times . There must be a better way of doing it which would look more sensible to Europe 's citizens .
I appeal to the Commission to instigate an enquiry as to how this can be improved .
A lot of the specific subject areas within the report will be covered by people who follow me .
I just want to concentrate on one issue and one issue only , which has been referred to by Mr Kellett-Bowman , and that is the DAS .
The DAS will enhance the sound financial management of the Community 's budget - we all accept that - but there are problems , as the Court of Auditors indicated .
So we await the Commission 's response on that .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as a Parliament we have a different task from that of the Court of Auditors .
In the area of social policy , it reveals a gulf between the requirements , in terms of European social policy , and the European social policy that exists .
It is then further reflected in individual structural problems .
If we grant a discharge , we must recognize , on the one hand , that although European social policy is needed , it is not being practised .
However , we must also ask ourselves - and I would explicitly endorse what Mr Wynn said on this point - who is responsible in each instance .
We must , therefore , grant discharge to the Commission , because we have succeeded in establishing to our satisfaction that it is not the Commission that is at fault here .
In many cases , there are no written reports on these matters . The Commission should not rely too heavily on the implementing authorities or firms to provide effective monitoring .
This problem with the Cultural Foundation is a scandal , but it is already two years old .
We in Parliament have brought the scandal to light , and set the wheels in motion to have it discussed .
If we do not grant this discharge , we may spark off a fresh debate about Lomé IV and financing .
We have just been involved in major controversy with the Council about these issues .
I find a great deal to criticize in Lomé IV too , but we are talking here about the only forum for North-South dialogue .
This political dialogue has to be important to us .
Therefore , we should not see it destroyed because of this one instance .
We should use this budget discharge as an occasion to exert pressure on the national governments . Mr Wolf has just said that we must place a share of the responsibility on the national governments .
That is what we must do . It is my belief that if we proceed by making an example of this scandal , the effect we produce will be disproportionate to our analysis .
When I turn to the Council I have to say that its attitude in the process is deplorable .
The clearance of accounts is in the Member States .
I believe , however , that it is depressing to note that there are so many repetitions in the discharge reports , year after year .
We must impose a requirement that if the regulations are not observed , aid will be reduced , so that there are also consequences in this area for failure to comply with the applicable rules .
However , the very fact of discussing these deficiencies openly and frankly can go some way towards generating confidence . Nothing should be swept under the carpet .
As I see it , there are two main areas of difficulty .
We must cut the ground from under the opportunists .
What do I meant by that ?
My colleague Mr Samland , and of course the Council , will have more to say on this point .
That applies equally to the European Development Fund and to the common foreign and security policy .
I would therefore say to all those who argue that a refusal to grant discharge would be an insult to development policy in general and our commitments under the Lomé Convention in particular : it is quite the opposite !
The financial subculture that we are currently sustaining is creating major administrative weaknesses .
There is a major procedural loophole , and unfortunately it now also affects discharge , because at the end of the day , Parliament cannot discharge the Council .
With regard to Mrs Kjer Hansen , it was very clear that where there are corrections to be made , this should not be a political , negotiable matter .
It should be an objective matter based on the actual loss . I follow Mr Cornelissen 's report on this point .
He explained that the money was not recovered because no Member State had applied to the Court .
This really will not do .
I am very critical of the Member States .
They are dealing here with the European taxpayers ' money .
They do not seem to take it seriously enough .
We should not be giving the fig leaf of respectability that was mentioned by getting involved in a procedure where we really cannot act properly because we do not have proper control .
If I could have that assurance I could advise my group . If it does not make any financial difference , if it does not destroy their confidence , then I could go along with the refusal to discharge .
But I would quite like to hear about that .
But do you know what this Foundation 's budget is ? I say this for the benefit of those who listen to us here : ECU 810 , 000 or 0.04 % of the EDF .
I tabled an amendment which simply specified these amounts . Without being contested , this amendment was rejected .
Why ? In truth it was because the decision on discharge had been made in advance .
Let me say something more on these four points , and firstly on tobacco . We have a report before us from the Court of Auditors on this issue .
The same applies to the wine sector , which is a virtual disaster . We insisted that a register should be compiled - properly compiled in every Member State .
Whose fault is it that the reform proposals have not been properly implemented ? As in the previous case I referred to , the culprit is the Council .
Furthermore , the Council has some 256 decisions pending , whereas here in Parliament we have only 52 decisions in the pipeline . That shows where the bottleneck and the imbalance between the institutions is to be found .
The Council referred to the European Regional Development Fund , but it did not take a position on the European Development Fund . Mr Wynn warned that the discharge would be suspended .
Does the Council wish to speak again or wait until a later occasion ?
I deplore the disgrace of the management of the Cultural Foundation .
It was a scandal which was investigated by the Bureau of the Joint Assembly of the Lomé Convention of which I was a member .
We called witnesses and carpeted individuals , including a key Member of the European Parliament . I make that specific point to be fair to the Commission .
He performed his task well in so far as he could .
Our comments have been directed mainly at the Member States , but it is not the Member States to whom we must grant discharge .
The first innovation is our vote on the clearance of accounts for the EAGGF , submitted by the Commission for 1991 . Clearance of accounts was previously classed as a technical procedure for which the Commission was responsible .
A particular problem which has been brought out into the open is the loss to the Community of some ECU 1.6 billion on milk quotas in three Member States .
Recent visitors to Brussels were taken aback by the continuing construction of the European Parliament 's new headquarters there , which has been going on since 1990 , and the ornate nature of the building in question .
This latter-day glass Tower of Babel is utterly unnecessary and a waste of resources which Parliament could have more constructively utilized for other aspects of its work .
It is particularly ironic that we are discussing budgetary and fiscal matters today in this Parliament . If ever there was an example of budgetary irresponsibility , it is the grandiose edifice currently taking shape in Brussels .
First of all , what he says about agriculture . I think that in future it will be almost impossible to forecast agricultural expenditure with any accuracy .
If a political decision is to be taken on how the rules are to be revised , I think it should be a matter for the Commission , the Council and Parliament together .
My second comment concerns the PHARE programme .
Could we not bring officials from the agriculture ministries in the countries of the former Eastern bloc over to Brussels , and send DG VI people to those countries to explain its policy ?
It is doing practically nothing to implement directives on public contracts or the environment .
Let me give you one example of what I mean about public contracts .
The situation with the environment is no better .
I entirely agree with what Mr Liikanen said in a letter concerning Community customs , that the Commission has no choice but to carry on enforcing existing legislation . That is just as it should be .
But in my experience , it is not what the Commission actually does . There are other factors involved here : inadequate control procedures and monitoring committees , and its failure to apply Article 24 correctly .
In short , when it comes to the Structural Funds the Commission , the supposed guardian of the Treaties , is a complete failure and needs to look very closely at how it can do better .
The attack by Mr Killilea was not worthy of a Member of Parliament .
If he had attended regularly to the business of this House he would have known that we were consulted .
I support his refusal of discharge . I am not looking at it in the area of the European Development Fund .
It is a most infinitely complicated business to try to forecast what the cost of agriculture will be for any year . Parliament is continuously a little bit harsh insofar as this sort of criticism is concerned .
Madam President , I will refer to the report by our esteemed colleague Mr Edward Kellett-Bowman on postponement of the discharge to the Management Board of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training in Thessaloniki .
I would like to draw Members ' attention to paragraph 11 in Mr Blak 's report that is on the UK pit closures .
The question of the staffing of UCLAF is similarly important .
I have been following the debate today with interest , because it has focused quite clearly on the question of finding a culprit : was it the Member States , or was it the Commission ?
I see this as a rather fruitless line of inquiry .
The European Parliament is being shuttled here from pillar to post .
I cannot entirely absolve the Commission from blame .
I think this is extremely questionable . Indeed , it has to be asked whether the Commission takes the whole business seriously enough , and I would simply remind you of how the debate opened .
I was not made sufficiently aware today of the way in which the Council and the Member States are involved in this whole process .
I also think that in many cases , the Commission 's attitude to Member States which step out of line , by failing to observe the conditions , is half-hearted .
I already see reason enough to ask whether we should not be thinking in terms of closure .
Contrary to the view of one of the previous speakers , Mr Kellett-Bowman made it very clear that there is no assurance at all that this centre is performing its functions efficiently .
In conclusion , I should simply like to make a point which I think has been neglected this year - that just as we have been looking at expenditure , we must also consider revenue .
We referred to the fact that this task is being undertaken in the committee of inquiry .
However , the committee reflects only some of the major concerns in this area which we need to discuss .
I suspect that other aims and aspirations lie behind this attitude , such as restricting CEDEFOP 's activities and closing it down , as the report indirectly implies .
It simply will not wash with the public and they will see the hypocrisy of our policies .
Therefore , I ask the Commission and the Council to take action .
Two years ago I tabled parliamentary questions on this matter . As yet we have had no results on that .
Increased accountability and transparency must be given top priority , including increased monitoring of programme spending for the newly-independent states of the former Soviet Union .
I should like to apologise for the delay at the beginning but we were spending time together with members of the Committee on Budgets and presidency trying to solve the problems of next year 's budgetary procedure .
Madam President , a very brief comment concerning the European Development Fund .
I would point out that the Fund is financed via direct contributions from the Member States and not with appropriations from the Community budget .
Madam President , we must correct that statement if it is going to be in the record .
This was followed by a statement from the Council informing us that we do not have any responsibility whatsoever to discharge the EDF .
Could they get their act together and tell us what the situation is ?
I would therefore ask for this point to be checked again .
We will take note of this .
The next item is Question Time to the Commission ( B4-0431 / 96 ) .
I posed this question because the opponents of cooperation under Schengen always maintain that accession to Schengen will make it more difficult to catch criminal gangs .
As the honourable Member is aware , the Commission is taking part in the meetings of the Schengen Executive Committee as an observer .
Mr President , I should like to take up the issue raised by Mr Haarder 's question .
Controls are in any case possible far from frontier zones and , on occasion , even at the frontier , but they have to be based on the assumption that the frontier has been crossed .
Some change is surely bound to happen in connection with the Schengen Agreement ?
I apologize to Commissioner Flynn and to Mr McMahon who rushed to the Chamber for this question .
Question No 20 by Brian Crowley ( H-0240 / 96 )
However , he is somewhat misguided in what he has said . Indeed he is throwing a very unusual veil of secrecy over what is going on .
He said that the duty-free mechanism is contrary to the internal market . Yet one of the major points of any internal market should be the harmonization of VAT and excise duty ratings .
I will try to be brief although the matter is not particularly simple . Duty and tax-free sales to intra-Community travellers at airports , on aircraft or on ferries have been authorized by the Council until 30 June 1999 .
So the relevant event which logically produces the necessity for an end to the dutyfree system is not the future definitive VAT regime but is something which has already been substantially in place since 1 January 1993 .
I should like to thank the Commissioner for the observations he has made . My own view is that it is a complex matter , as he has said .
I do not know that the case has yet been well established that the scale of alleged distortion is in some way a significant problem or impediment to the functioning of the internal market .
This document , which was drawn up in cooperation with the authorities in the Member States , is now being looked at by the Commission 's services .
That is the way it is in many places in Europe . A different transport pattern is produced when duty free sales are done away with in this manner .
What are the procedures involved in claiming back VAT on goods and services purchased across the European continent by long-distance lorry drivers ?
I am afraid we have not been able so far to identify any such possibility .
Some of this cooperation will be achieved through the development of a Union-wide system for information exchange within a European police office , known as Europol .
The aim of Europol is to improve the opportunities for the competent authorities in the Member States to fight serious forms of international organised crime within the European Union .
In accordance with the Convention there will be close cooperation with Interpol . The Council will establish provisions formalising this cooperation and ensure that the various functions complement one another .
Swedish police chiefs have also expressed public criticism , including the former National Head of Police , who is also a former President of Interpol , who asked more or less the same question .
I would therefore repeat the question : what is Europol expected to do in practical terms which Interpol does not already do or could do ?
Question No 23 by Eva Kjer Hansen ( H-0274 / 96 )
The Commission uses all appropriate means in its fight against fraud which damages the Community 's economic interests .
The most recent programme of work to combat fraud indicates clearly where the priorities lie .
There are four main points . The first concerns an increased presence in the field .
The third main point concerns improving Community legislation .
The fourth point deals with the need for greater harmonisation of the Member States ' national legislation .
The Commission has looked at the issue of sanctions as part of both point 3 and point 4 . In this context it is important to distinguish between administrative sanctions and penalties under the criminal law .
It was based on Article 235 of the Treaty of Rome and Article 203 of the Euratom Treaty . The Regulation contains general rules governing the administrative sanctions which should be applied in the event of irregularities .
All areas of Community expenditure are covered , as are own resources . As you know , sanctions have already been introduced in certain areas , such as agriculture .
I would like to express my thanks for the reply and for the summing up of the contents of the work programme and the provisions already adopted .
I would therefore ask the Commissioner to confirm that what we are trying to achieve is a common system of sanctions in all areas .
We can only go on with additional protocols and so on , in order to arrive at common forms of cooperation , once the convention has been ratified by all the parliaments .
A brief follow-up question : 70-80 % of EU resources are used within the individual Member States .
I very recently saw in my own country , Sweden , that it had been suggested there that a special national body should be set up to deal with fraud involving EU funds .
I consider this to be a good initiative because it would also make it easier to press on in the individual Member States without perhaps having to resort to common , possibly even supranational , sanctions .
This naturally gives rise to considerable ambiguity and uncertainty as regards the obligations the countries have vis-à-vis one another .
Would new EU Member States perhaps not also have to be covered by the WEU mutual security guarantees , and what consequences would that have for the EU 's relations with Russia ?
But let me give the honourable Member one example of how we can overcome the difficulties that she has identified .
Mr President , I should like to begin by abusing the privilege of the microphone to congratulate the Commissioner on the success of the donors ' conference on Saturday .
Subject : EU and Belarus
The European Parliament has protested ( 12.10.1995 ) against the authorities ' conduct during a strike in Minsk in August 1995 . The EU has now concluded an interim agreement with a view to a partnership agreement with Belarus .
The Commission thought very carefully before finally submitting the interim agreement to the Council for signature , after the earlier postponement because of the situation in Belarus .
Commissioner , I am interested in a number of points in relation to what you have said .
How do you view the fact that Decree No 336 , which maintains the ban on trade unions , has not yet been repealed ?
It has organized a number of workshops and other meetings with representatives of the governments and railways involved in the Brenner axis .
Road capacity is limited and the environment is under enormous pressure , so rail transport is the only possible option . My question , Commissioner , is as follows .
We are well aware in the Commission of the pressures that come both from the geographical features and the potential action of neighbouring countries .
Is the Commission aware that there is discrimination against foreign lorries when checks on driving and rest periods are carried out ?
We heed what the honourable Member says .
Construction of the bridge across the Øresund , between Malmö and Copenhagen , has just begun .
Even at this initial stage , the environmental and financial calculations have proved to be incorrect .
Over the period 1992-1994 Danish access routes of the Øresund fixed link received Community financial support under the transport infrastructure programme , totalling ECU 21 m in the form of direct grants to the Danish authorities .
The co-finance studies for the Danish access routes in 1995 included technical design studies , as well as environmental studies and monitoring .
Further financial support is envisaged for the period 1996-1999 since the Øresund fixed link is a key element in the development of the trans-European transport network .
Indeed , it is a transEuropean network transport priority project .
Mr President , I would thank the Commissioner for his answer .
I should like to know whether the Commission or the EU has imposed any environmental requirements in granting the funds for the bridge .
There is also much to suggest that the bridge will be more expensive than was expected . It is possible that there might also be the financing of access routes such as the city tunnel in Malmö and others .
We hope that that situation will not be an exception and will represent a change in the doctrine hitherto followed by the Council and the Commission as regards the legal bases relating to international fisheries agreements .
But underlying all that , as was also emphasized at the recent plenary sitting on 27 March in Brussels , the urgent need to revise and strengthen the European Union 's policy with regard to international fishing agreements .
Politically the European Union 's fisheries and external and commercial policy must be linked . Institutionally this Parliament must be definitively associated , strictly and as of right , with the negotiation , approval and control of these agreements .
In this agreement there are a number of aspects which greatly improve on other international agreements which Parliament has looked at .
Mr President , with regard to the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco , we ought not to lose sight of overall relations between the two countries and the way they have been developing .
In every international agreement there must be a symmetry which respects and , to the highest degree possible , satisfies the needs of the contracting parties .
The weakness of the European Union 's position cannot be attributed , in our opinion , to the Committee on Fisheries or to Mrs Bonino , but is due to the attitude of certain States within the Council .
The agreement is not satisfactory for us because it creates a precedent for renegotiation of the agreement .
As well as that , in some of these countries there is a desire to reduce EU access to their fish stocks because they are over-exploited and need time to recover .
These cutbacks will obviously affect the EU fishermen , especially the Spanish and , to a lesser extent , the French , who are the main beneficiaries of the agreements .
To alleviate the pain the Union undertook at the General Affairs Council of 10 November 1995 to make proposals for a fund to promote ornamental plant products .
That is unacceptable !
Products from third countries are therefore being imported almost entirely without duties .
It is high time that the European Union did something about it .
Is the Commissioner ready to give an undertaking ?
Mr President , I welcome the Arias Cañete report . I welcome the agreement and I welcome the fact that the Commission was able to reach this agreement with Morocco .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I think we must welcome the fact that this fisheries agreement between the European Union and Morocco has been reached .
Mr President , a cooperation agreement on fisheries has been concluded with Morocco .
As the fishing agreement now stands , the riches of the Western Sahara territorial waters do not benefit the Saharan people .
I therefore ask the Commission , who negotiated this agreement , to make sure that international law is respected .
Mr President , I congratulate the Commission and the rapporteur on this , but I have two problems .
I shall not oppose the agreement but there are two political points that need to be made .
One concerns Morocco itself .
As he normally does , he did a very thorough and informative job on this .
Obviously I am concerned that Parliament is not getting its full constitutional rights in relation to these agreements . ECU 500 m is a significant amount of money and we are entitled to codecision-making under the Maastricht Treaty .
We are now going to be issuing an opinion five months after the agreement was approved and more than four months after it entered into force .
On the whole , these guidelines are in keeping with the proposals which we defended throughout , in terms of this agreement , even though they really fall short of what is necessary .
Mr President , most representatives of the Andalusian fisheries sector say that this agreement is the best of those signed between the European Union and Morocco - simply the best .
Let me sincerely congratulate the negotiators who have certain been a homogeneous team , which has acted firmly and calmly , waiting for the right time , and in the end decisively .
They have done well .
It is an agreement which was so difficult but which has turned out so well .
I notice that Mr Arias Cañete is not saying what he was saying before the Spanish elections .
Mr President , the first assessment we must make is of the agreement itself . The compromise achieved is the best possible .
We should all perhaps have liked a different one which would have safeguarded the rights of the 80 vessels which will be left outside the fishing grounds .
We must also congratulate the Commission on having sent Parliament a copy of the agreement as soon as it was signed .
It therefore decided to consult Parliament by means of the assent procedure . That possibility constitutes an important recognition of the European Parliament 's rights and powers .
As the Commissioner is present I should like to make a brief remark which may only touch on this debate , but is important in these times .
ECU 500 million is not chickenfeed . I therefore protest formally against the systematic bypassing of this House and insist once again upon our contractually guaranteed participatory rights .
Nevertheless , in view of the great importance we all attach to this agreement , the Committee on Budgets approved it unanimously .
We made our approval subject to three provisos , however .
Above all , it places the emphasis on an issue important to us , that of the conservation and sound management of stocks .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me thank Mr Poggioloni for this excellent report .
The harmonization of data is essential to provide each country with a basis of comparison to enable it to review its own health policy and to allow each state to react more quickly and effectively to rectify undesirable trends .
And it is true that both the Commission communication and the report constitute important progress and we welcome that .
The first omission is related to the social context in which this report is made : it seems that the health of Europeans is likely to deteriorate for three reasons .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if there is any single sure belief shared by all industrialized countries , it is that fundamental choices must now be made over a public health policy .
This is what the Commission 's document proposes and that is the message our rapporteur is conveying with some skill in amending that document .
The majority of the Council preferred not to go beyond simple coordination .
The Commission is therefore proposing to us a rather vague public health monitoring system , but whatever form this new instrument takes , it must be efficient and operational .
Thus , the Commission proposes to analyse the state of health of European citizens , to evaluate the impact of Community action programmes and to supply Member States with information on that state of health .
Mr President , we are discussing the proposed programme of Community action on health monitoring . The programme was already announced in the Commission 's communication on the framework for Community action in the field of public health .
Therefore , it does not permit the monitoring of health and health determinants in the European Union in a meaningful , useful and effective way . This point was very much made by Mr Poggiolini .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
In practice , the aim of the health card is to facilitate freedom of movement for persons within the European Union by guaranteeing them proper access to the treatment their health requires .
A document of this kind also has economic benefits , including in relation to the social security systems of the Member States - the savings produced as a result of cutting out duplicated health checks , for example .
I am therefore asking the Commission to draw up , by 1 January 1997 , a draft decision of the Council and Parliament on the establishment , with effect from 1 January 1999 , of a European health card .
We are , of course , in agreement with the main points in the communication , but in our report we lay stress on certain aspects that appear to us to be essential .
We are obliged to find increasingly appropriate solutions to deal with the problems arising from Alzheimer 's and other diseases related to ageing populations .
It is for the Member States of the European Union to define certain policies and strategies so that the whole problem related to neuro-degenerative diseases can be tackled in their medical , social , financial and other aspects .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the two aims being pursued are indeed the restoration and strengthening of confidence in the safety of the transfusion chain and the achievement of self-sufficiency in blood .
The monitoring and regulation required provoked a general outcry , precisely in the name of the free movement of goods .
We must demand that a standard file be drawn up on all donors .
Finally , in connection with the haemovigilance network , a truly harmonized European system should be able to rely on the regulatory framework already established in Directive 89 / 381 .
The European Parliament already asked for precisely this in its resolution of November 1993 .
Mr President , the European Parliament did not wait until the Maastricht Treaty was adopted to place constant emphasis on all public health issues .
Mr President , all of us must be greatly concerned with Alzheimer 's as a degenerative disease of the brain that inevitably leads to the destruction of all mental and physical functions .
Ultimately , it renders its victims immobile , unable to recognize even their closest family members .
At present , there is virtually no treatment for the disease and no cure either .
It is inevitably a terminal disease .
I do not believe there is enough money available for the fight against Alzheimer 's disease , for establishing specialized out-patient facilities or even hospital wards .
This money is not to be used for the absolutely essential research into Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease either . The Commission ought to consider where else it could obtain these resources .
In our modern society , we have conquered some traditional illnesses but others have come into being .
To prevent that form of infection it is therefore vital that we pay the greatest attention to the difficulties involved in transfusion .
In the light of those circumstances , we need therefore to reinforce the preventive criteria and set in place all possible arrangements to protect our citizens .
The number of people over 60 suffering from this disease is growing alarmingly .
Patients become completely dependent as a result of their illness .
At one point he refers in particular to the fact that developing countries are little affected by this illness because life expectancy there is too low . That is poignant and also significant .
But it is striking that in our society the current ideology projects only the image of the ideal person as young and healthy . We are scared of old age , sickness and death .
The crux of this problem naturally lies in the loss of the purpose of this earthly existence . Without the hope of the gospel death is always final .
But let us learn to accept that sickness and old age form part of our existence . In our society we seem to want to detach that from our daily existence .
By that we deny the value of our fellow human beings with their own place in creation . Because that is what they are : fellow human beings , nothing more , nothing less .
There is something positive about that . But at the same time it brings with it issues and difficulties , and that is what we are faced with in this report .
To name one specific successful model , the Alzheimer telephone .
We shall abstain on Amendment No 1 . It is I suppose a relevant subject , but not in this report , rather in a report in which we are discussing ethical limits in research .
Mr President , may I begin by congratulating and complimenting Mr Poggiolini on the excellent reports he has drawn up . I mean that genuinely and sincerely .
I think it can be seen here that a doctor , actually a president of the Italian specialist medical association , can also be a very good politician . I greatly respect that .
Mr President , I should like to say something about problems of safety in transfusion that should also appear on the agenda of a Council planned by the Irish presidency next autumn .
Mr President , the affair at the centre of Professor Cabrol 's excellent report , i.e. that of contaminated blood , has not taught us a lesson .
What has led to contamination by bovine spongiform encephalopathy , to AIDS through contaminated blood and to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease through contaminated meat , has arisen from a single cause : ideology .
The ideology of mixing : mixing blood from all sources , mixing meal from all sources .
The ideology of obscurantism , of deliberately ignoring the origin of blood or the origin of meat .
In the business of contaminated blood and contaminated meat , capitalist companies have privatized the profits and nationalized the compensation for damages .
The polluter has not been the payer , it is the taxpayer who has paid .
There , ladies and gentlemen , in the final analysis , are the causes of the contaminated blood disaster , the causes of the BSE disaster . Democratic sanction no longer exists .
The federal idea is a prion . If anything is to be eradicated , it is the European Commission that should be eradicated from the institutions of Europe .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Poggiolini on his report .
It is the most common , chronic , terminal illness among our older people .
In my own country of Scotland , which has a population of five million , there are an estimated 61 , 000 people suffering from dementia .
It is reckoned that this figure will rise to around 73 , 000 by the early part of next century .
Dementia is not just an old person 's disease . The one serious point that Mr Martinez made is that we are learning that from some of the new cases of CJD .
There are between 2 , 000 and 3 , 000 people in Scotland alone between the ages of 30 and 65 suffering from dementia . Dementia knows no social , national or economic boundaries .
The Commission could use its good offices to bring together health and social care experts to disseminate good practice .
We could also use some of our existing research programmes such as BIOMED to play a greater role in fostering and motivating research in this particular area .
I should indeed be grateful to the Commissioner if he would tell us which elements he is able to endorse and what can be done to ensure that the health card will actually be introduced soon .
A number of controversies regarding infected blood supplies in some European Union countries - including the Hepatitis B incident in Ireland - have somewhat dented public confidence in the blood transfusion chain .
For many decades Austria has had an exemplary system of blood and plasma collection , which I should like to outline . The mixed system comprises Red Cross branches , hospitals and industry .
The system , which has evolved over a period of time , consists of blood-donor centres run by non-profit organizations and of private plasmapheresis centres where plasma is collected for industrial fractionation .
Back in 1975 a special law was passed to regulate plasmapheresis , the first such legislation in the world .
This figure was achieved by around 14 000 donors in 13 plasmapheresis centres . The voluntary nature of these donations and the fact that the donors receive no payment are regarded as self-evident .
The plasma is not bought from the donor , although plasma donors in Austria naturally receive appropriate compensation for their time and for travel to and from the centres .
Each country has its own system , and all of them work more or less effectively .
We must accept that , in the realm of blood and plasma collection , the systems vary and operate on mixed bases .
Whether these are commercial or nonprofitmaking , the aims for Europe remain the same , namely efficiency and selfsufficiency .
Mr President , I wish to bring to the attention of Commissioner Flynn the kind of problems experienced by European citizens which have been brought to me by a constituent .
A constituent 's son went to Greece and suffered an injury there .
Of course he presented his E111 form when he returned to the United Kingdom but was told that the receipt which he had obtained from the doctor was invalid because it did not contain a perforation on it .
Imagine the problem that young man faced : exhausted , tired and upset , he was required to insist upon a receipt with perforations on it .
You will recall this is one of a series of resolutions , the first of which was in 1981 .
Indeed , Mr Leopardi , in an excellent report , says that much in part of the resolution .
We ask the Commission to come forward with this and we hope very much that the Commissioner will respond in the way I have described .
At present the European Parliament has 626 Members . The average age is about 45 .
One third of Members are 55 or older . Statistically , within ten years five to fifteen of our fellow-Members will be suffering from Alzheimer 's disease .
A Community action programme with a special and not merely symbolical budget heading ought to be able to supplement the existing Community initiatives and coordinate the campaigns started by the Member States up to a certain level .
One final point , Mr President , we must not play patients off against one another on budgetary grounds or compare one patient with another .
But as rapporteur for Community programmes on behalf of the elderly I must sincerely ask that this group of the population should not be forgotten .
That is a principle which should be recognized by certain Member States which are still sceptical about a joint approach to certain problems as serious or as important as the three which are before the House today .
Congratulations to Mr Poggiolini , Mr Leopardi and Mr Cabrol for their excellent work in which they consider respectively :
I want to make it clear that I support the communication , the report and the majority of the proposals , provided of course that some detailed changes are made .
While clarification was essential , the need to stress the safety of the donor and the recipient was even more so .
It is now imperative to promote the giving of blood by providing wide-ranging and precise information about blood , blood products and their use in treatment .
I should like to say a few words about what seems to be one of the most positive and future-looking ideas , namely a European health card .
As has been pointed out , these diseases affect millions of people throughout Europe . In Ireland it is estimated that about 25 , 000 are affected .
In many parts of Europe there is excellent experience of work on Alzheimer 's , but exchanges of information and the development of trans-national initiative remain at a low level .
Mr President , I am pleased to have the opportunity to present the Commission 's position on these three important health-related issues .
I deal first with Alzheimer 's disease and Mr Poggiolini 's report .
This is a very constructive decision .
Mr President , I should like to respond to the point raised by Commissioner Flynn .
I am glad he read the card . He makes a good point in saying that it is more limited than that described in the Leopardi report .
My concern is that if we make things too complicated we will go another ten years .
Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Madam President , I have a point concerning page 20 of the Minutes .
This only records part of what I said .
I also stated that rapporteurs , when they accept reports , should undertake to be present at the debate on those reports .
I should like those details to be included in the Minutes .
I can testify to what you say , Mr Fabre-Aubrespy .
That will therefore be corrected .
( Parliament approved the Minutes )
European Council in Turin
It gives me great pleasure to welcome to the European Parliament the Presidentin-Office of the Council , Prime Minister Lamberto Dini .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Turin European Council marked an important new stage on the road to determining the nature of the process of European integration in the future .
From this point of view the Turin European Council fully achieved the objective we had set ourselves .
In fact , the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference clearly establishes the issues to be given particular attention in negotiating the revision of the Treaty .
I consider it significant that it has been possible to achieve unanimous agreement on a list of priorities involving delicate and controversial topics .
The democracy and efficiency of the institutions has always been one of the great strengths of the Union .
These characteristics will be maintained by adapting mechanisms and procedures to changed circumstances and to the prospect of further enlargement of our Union .
For these reasons the second major chapter of the conference agenda deals with the representativeness , composition , and operating methods of the institutions .
In an international situation of turbulent change , the promotion and defence of our common values constitutes a profound argument in favour of the process of European integration .
These represent a series of tests for the conference .
Although satisfied with the work done and the results obtained at Turin , the Italian presidency is by no means minimizing the problems that lie ahead of us .
The official documents presented by the governments of some Member States confirm the existence of differences , indeed profound differences , on essential issues .
So the conference is going to have a difficult task over the one year period planned for its work .
Fully respecting the duty of impartiality incumbent on the presidency , Italy will work to promote the emergence of high profile consensus on the various subjects under discussion .
On 22 March the Italian government approved its own document on the objectives of the conference .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Madrid European Council granted a mandate for defining ways in which the European Parliament could be closely associated with the work of the conference .
I shall not go over the various stages of that negotiation again here , as our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Under Secretary Ferraris , who is here today , have already had an opportunity to illustrate its progress .
The Italian presidency has never made a secret of its preference for an association of the European Parliament inspired by the formula successfully applied during the work of the reflection group .
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs therefore drew up a compromise solution which the Turin European Council subsequently approved .
I would like to add my personal thanks for the helpfulness and cooperation shown towards the presidency in the difficult week of negotiations on the method of associating the European Parliament with the conference .
One of the purposes of this exercise of revising the Treaty is to prepare the Union for the enlargement .
That is why we felt we had a duty to invite the eleven candidate countries of central , eastern and Mediterranean Europe to Turin immediately after the European Council .
We intend to maintain assiduous contact with them and also provide appropriate information to Switzerland and the countries of the European Economic Area .
The Turin agenda is realistic yet ambitious .
It will not be easy to meet the commitment to complete the negotiations within the first six months of 1997 .
This consideration has led us to plan a tight schedule of meetings over the next few weeks .
The presidency intends to submit its own interim report to the Florence European Council to provide a basis for the continuing work of the conference .
The Turin European Council debated the problems of unemployment and job creation in Europe at length .
The Council also dwelt at length on initiatives that could be taken more immediately .
On that basis the European Council defined a comprehensive strategy and its content and detail has been successively improved at Essen , Cannes and Madrid .
But we cannot feel satisfied with the results achieved .
The BSE issue also raises more general considerations about the need to handle complex issues without ideological prejudice and dogma .
This is a necessary process and will be intensified , but always respecting strict limits and maintaining adequate controls when the protection of public assets , health and the environment is at stake .
Mr President , Mr President-in - Office , ladies and gentlemen , on 29 March in Turin , the European Council launched the Intergovernmental Conference .
It approved the guidelines for the negotiations and the way in which the European Parliament would be involved .
The decisions taken at the European Council in Madrid were therefore acted upon .
This decision certainly falls short of your expectations and ours , but does allow Parliament to be associated with the work in hand , which to my mind is essential .
The document 's main aim , which is worth noting , is to ensure that there is consensus on the issues to be dealt with during the Conference .
The fact that there was no such agreement before either the Single European Act or the Maastricht Treaty should be a salutary reminder .
It is notable that the basic document produced by the European Council once again clearly focuses attention on the main problems afflicting our peoples , whilst emphasizing Europe 's role in overcoming them .
It would not be acceptable to reform the Treaty without first convincing our citizens that Europe does really care about their problems .
This does not , of course , guarantee that the work carried out during the Conference will automatically be successful .
Such an outcome can only be achieved through the efforts of the negotiators and the institutions to secure both a compromise and a quality result .
It is also worth noting that the European Council has highlighted the enlargement issue - a challenge which Europe must face up to in the future .
We need to outline a Europe-wide scheme for peace and cooperation for the twenty-first century .
The number of debates that have taken place before as well as in the wake of the European Council in Turin , on topics covered by the Conference and on Europe in general , is impressive .
This seems to me to augur well for Europe in the future , since it needs to elicit the attention and interest of its citizens .
This ultimately remains with them .
The Commission intends to carry out its role with this in mind .
It is the very model we are offering those countries whose aim is accession to the Union .
However , to keep it intact , we need to introduce the far-reaching reforms set out in the opinion put forward by the Commission on 28 February .
If Europe does not concern itself with the plight of its 18 million unemployed , then it has no meaning .
The Union must project a strong image - a guarantee of peace and stability - particularly throughout our own continent .
The institutions will have to be adapted to deal with the Union 's new dimensions and responsibilities .
The principle of unanimity causes paralysis , particularly as regards enlargement .
Flexibility must therefore be considered and Parliament 's role strengthened if we wish to establish a firm democratic reference point .
We cannot offer applicant countries membership of a Union that is neither sufficiently prepared nor democratic enough to welcome them .
It concerned my proposal to introduce a European pact on employment , which I had the opportunity of putting forward in Turin .
The Heads of State and Government reaffirmed their commitment to job creation and agreed to attach the utmost importance to this issue at the Council meeting in Florence .
My aim is to encourage actions to combat unemployment .
It is clear that most of these measures need to be carried out at national level .
I do not wish to impose my own ideas , but rather encourage a dialogue between governments and social partners , in order to boost confidence .
What we are lacking is a coherent policy on employment through which to implement its proposals .
Governments and the social partners have a special responsibility to combat unemployment .
The Socialist Group shares that view .
The Socialist Group also appreciates the work that has been done on citizenship , justice and home affairs .
Of course there are unresolved problems , ignored by the Council or inadequately dealt with , and they are set out one by one in the joint resolution .
So , while we appreciate the need for the reinforced cooperation clause , it is not clear whether and how it also guarantees the necessary institutional unity .
The Union 's social policy is still in limbo .
We are far from finding a satisfactory solution to fundamental problems relating to the institutional structure and the instruments of common foreign and security policy , even though these are already in place .
It will be the task of the conference to resolve this , of course .
We hope that these negotiations will be completed in Amsterdam under the Dutch presidency by the end of June 1997 .
Seldom , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , has a tableau been drawn up so full of fundamental questions and challenges facing the European Union .
Seldom too in the history of European unification was the risk so great that we would lose control of the political goal to which our generation owes decades of peace and prosperity .
That is the reason for our political responsibility in the months ahead .
We have inherited the fifty years which is now drawing to a close from the forwardlooking political courage of the statesmen who planned and built up the Community of peace and progress .
The question we must answer is the following : what do we want to leave to the coming generation ?
What kind of Europe are we going to hand on to the younger generation ?
What kind of message of hope can we transmit to the young people who all too often in our countries are deprived of the right to work and develop ?
Our people are frightened when they think of the future .
We do not underestimate the difficulties of the negotiations .
That would be the worst possible hypothesis , for that would mean a postponement of all the basic problems .
In this respect I would remind you of a famous declaration and confirm that our group will never be satisfied with the European convoy only sailing at the speed of the slowest ships .
The EPP Group can accept the way in which the European Parliament will be involved in the IGC .
A public debate was wanted .
This time a new treaty will not only be negotiated by ministers , technocrats and diplomats , but the voice of the people in Europe will be heard through those whom they democratically elected .
But perhaps it is legitimate to voice a slight suspicion that there are three days to go before the Italian elections and Europe is unfortunately being used as a platform for national issues .
As the Member of the European Parliament for Turin , I had the good fortune to be present at the Turin Conference , though certainly not by official invitation .
I was present for the public part of the conference of course , certainly not in the control centre which not even President Hänsch was invited to , unfortunately .
I saw and heard many important things .
Certainly not everything this Parliament wanted to hear , but many of them are vital , if they are properly followed up .
Obviously this must not be allowed to come to an end on 30 June in Florence when , as President Dini mentioned , the six months of the Italian presidency ends .
One issue dealt with in Turin stands out , although it is still clouded by the more pressing problem of mad cow disease , and that is the issue of employment .
What we say on employment , as a group , is that we should not be trying to create the new jobs where mechanization and robotization is gradually eliminating them .
They must be made to emerge in economic sectors and on a business scale that we have underestimated so far .
I am talking about small and medium-sized enterprises , the only real alternative for the socio-economic development of the European market .
Mr President , the future belongs to small and medium-sized enterprises .
They must be supported in every possible way .
I shall end , Mr President , by recalling an idea Minister Agnelli has already expressed here in Strasbourg .
It will be up to those involved in the Intergovernmental Conference to make good that shortcoming .
And that is a great responsibility , since the future of Europe is at stake .
Improving the effectiveness of decision-making in the Council , maintaining the authority of the Commission and simplifying parliamentary procedures are essential reforms as the Union is now .
But the prospect of enlargement - which must be accepted , since Europe 's goal is that of opening its doors - makes these changes unavoidable .
Marking the existence of such an ambition at the outset will be a sign of hope that is expected by the great majority of Europe 's citizens .
Mr President , I want to thank the President-inOffice for being here just a few days before voting takes place in Italy , an event so important that it involves all the political and social forces of our country .
Moreover we feel there is insufficient commitment to dealing with the most serious problem in every European country , the problem of employment .
I think a different commitment is needed , one that involves all the social partners , and first and foremost the trade unions of the European countries .
Presidents Hänsch , Santer and Dini , ladies and gentlemen , one particular image of the Turin summit sticks in my mind .
The project to revise the Treaty , of course , had a spanner in its works from the very beginning , and in our view the Turin Council summit has done nothing to alter that .
The cosmetic involvement of the European Parliament that was decided upon is miles away from what we ourselves were demanding , namely a role in the ratification process .
Public participation and debate in the widest possible sense are the only ways to overcome the clandestine nature of the intergovernmental conference and to let public acceptance gain ground over Euroscepticism .
The fact is , of course , that the European Union pursues an unfathomable policy , its words speaking of transparency but its actions of secrecy .
So we can scarcely wonder at people being every bit as distant from the EU as the EU is from democracy .
The tide did not turn at Turin , and that is certainly not the fault of the presidency , which tried very hard .
Klaus Hänsch asked the Council not to let its meetings degenerate into declaratory summits , but now , when I compare the statements with what is actually happening , Mr Hänsch 's call remains a pious wish .
That is something they ought to tell us .
Where , then , are the guidelines for improving the environmental situation ?
What are we to think of the decisions on mad cow disease ?
Mr President , despite all the speeches and promises , the Maastricht Treaty appears increasingly to be the biggest stumbling-block to economic recovery and the fight against unemployment .
The figures are disastrous .
In Europe , the average rate of unemployment rose from 9.6 % to 11 % between 1990 and 1995 .
Six million jobs have been lost and 55 million people are living on the poverty line .
While some of their leaders engage in trivial pursuits , the French people are growing increasingly concerned about relinquishing national sovereignty , and how this will affect their daily lives .
- can only be a prelude to further withdrawals .
This puts us in mind of the Fourth Republic , and what is known as the policy of letting sleeping dogs lie .
A new referendum is now in order , in view of the insidious implementation of a federalist Treaty that only just secured enough votes in 1992 .
Life shows that any living creature that gives up the struggle is condemned to extinction !
Parliament 's lack of interest in your appearance , demonstrated by this empty Chamber , is a response to the lack of interest you have demonstrated towards us .
The President of the Italian Parliament , Mr Pivetti , came here to testify to the interest Italian Members of Parliament take in their European colleagues .
You never came , and you represent the Italian presidency .
But you come today , four days away from the Italian election .
But you should know you have done your country a disservice .
Decent men are capable of a little humility .
Shrewd politicians know that the form is often the substance and in terms of form you have been extremely rude to this Parliament .
This state of stagnation stands in the way of the creation of new wealth .
The challenge of becoming competitive is met with fear and a preference for sheltered niches , protected from innovation , forgetting that competitiveness is an indispensable condition for growth and employment .
You are silent about relocation , about fundamentalism , about the deaths caused by failure to achieve political union .
As regards the Verona Summit , I merely point out that the economic disorder which prevents Italy from enjoying the necessary credibility is the responsibility of many of your current electoral partners .
We hope that in the short time remaining to the Italian presidency the next government will be equal to the task of restoring the prestige Italy is entitled to .
Welcome
The visiting delegation is led by the President of the Thai National Assembly and includes parliamentarians from Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore and Vietnam .
On behalf of our entire House , may I bid you a warm welcome to the European Parliament and wish you every success in the work you are about to begin .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen of the AIPO , welcome to the European Parliament !
( Loud applause )
European Council in Turin ( continuation )
Mr President , I have listened with great interest to the views expressed this morning by honourable Members of the European Parliament .
We are all aware that we cannot build a Europe of unemployed people .
Europe has been an area of progress and prosperity in the past and we intend to make it so in the future .
Hence the initiatives on employment that are going to be taken at the Community level : President Santer 's initiative and the interministerial initiatives proposed for the near future .
In any case the fact remains - and I think it is indisputable - that employment problems have to be solved primarily through measures taken by the national governments .
I do not agree that the Turin document is vague .
The Turin document provides a mandate and puts the issues to be covered on the agenda .
I just want to say two things .
The discussion dealt exclusively with that .
I think it was a great success to achieve that objective , and that is also the opinion of the Finance Ministers who took part in the meeting .
Unfortunately that had to be abandoned because of the meeting at Sharm-el-Sheikh which the Heads of Government had set for the same date .
There will , I believe , be another opportunity for the Italian President-inOffice of the Council to come and report on the outcome of the June European Council before the end of the Italian presidency .
I think I have replied to the main points that have been made , but we will also take full account of each and every one of them .
( Applause )
Already , however , as the IGC , you have made the first historic mistake .
You have excluded us from your work .
Take note that this will stand in your way .
Our Parliament 's voice has been devalued .
I was surprised to learn that our two representatives , who will be silent recipients of regular information from you , had gone as far as actually to thank you for your relative willingness to provide it .
You should know , however , that Parliament does not thank you , but blames you most severely for its exclusion .
Unfortunately , however , your Conference does not seem to have the power to make History .
Some do not wish to , and others do not dare .
No strengthening of the Union 's bodies , nor any deepening of cohesion .
It is indeed unbelievable that you proclaimed the protection of our frontiers in a limited way and no more than that , and so did a disservice to the peoples who bear the brunt of safeguarding Europe 's frontiers .
On the subject of a more multi-speed Europe too , we have not heard positive messages .
Our aim should be to make the differences between the strong and the weak less pronounced , not to give those differences official expression and establish them institutionally .
I am still not sure that in the hands of this IGC the ideal of a United Europe will gain ground .
Europe 's credibility is in your hands .
Do not sacrifice it on the altar of any minor political expedients , whatever those may be .
It would be a pity for History one day to pronounce that your hands were shown to be lacking in strength and not entirely up to the opportunities this historic time offers .
Will Europe happen ?
Mr President , I yield to the temptation to borrow a phrase from Sir Christopher Wren on this occasion : ' Si monumentum requieres , circumspice ' .
There was nothing to report , sadly .
The European Union and its Member States have a number of very major political , social and economic problems to confront over the next few years .
At the same time existing Member States will have to prepare the way for the accession of up to 10 or even 15 new Member States from Central and Eastern Europe .
The likely accession of these countries will provide all Europe with a unique opportunity to work together for a peaceful and secure future .
A straightforward redistribution of the existing resources from the structural funds and the common agricultural policy will result in the Union 's agricultural regions taking on a disproportionately large share of the cost of enlargement .
The budget will have to be increased significantly if the existing common policies are to continue to operate effectively in an enlarged Union .
But a positive note has been struck , nevertheless .
We do note , however , certain omissions which are a cause for concern , but I would like to begin with the points which we feel are more positive .
It is recognised that the fight against unemployment must be our main priority - this calls for an economic policy which is orientated towards stability , greater competitiveness and far swifter growth .
As far as free circulation is concerned , there is an intention to implement coherent and effective policies in terms of asylum , emigration and visas , as well as stepping up controls at external borders .
The omissions which concern us start , for example , with the failure to make any reference to economic and social cohesion .
We are certain that the 15 heads of state and government will not call into question this principle because it is vital to European construction and must underlie all of its policies .
But it would be useful and reassuring if the principle could have been reiterated in the final communiqué , something which did not happen .
The same concern is also valid for the problem of statutory equalities .
What is firmly fixed , following the meeting in the wellguarded factory area in Turin , is some clear outline of what we can expect .
It is a clear procedure that has been adopted , and the outlines of the future Union are more or less clear .
This is also shown by the joint resolution which has been submitted by the large groups .
It concerns areas which are of decisive importance for the development of the European Union .
I believe that we will do so again , and if the Danish tradition is applied to the whole Union , then the Union project will encounter difficulties .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Dini has just told us that the Heads of Government were particularly concerned about employment .
That is good news , and I think Parliament can take some credit for making it understood that our citizens are deeply anxious about this problem .
Mr Dini also said that employment policy was above all the prerogative of the Member States .
No doubt that is true , but there are three points which I should like to make .
Firstly , Parliament believes that employment should be one of our guiding principles as we move towards economic and monetary union .
In introducing a single currency , we must have a goal , and this should naturally be employment .
Secondly , I believe that if the procedures approved in Essen are to bear fruit , they must be improved .
In our view , it would help to make employment a truly European issue - and this is essential - if a chapter on employment were to be inserted in the Treaty .
Thirdly , there can be no employment policy without a social policy .
This concept needs to be reiterated .
But I should also like to mention the status of the European Parliament , and to acknowledge the considerable effort which the Council and the Italian presidency have made in order to reach a solution .
I think the outcome is a purely symbolic one , but it should not be ignored .
But in its resolution last December , Parliament also referred to the interinstitutional conference .
It seems to me that relations between Parliament and the Intergovernmental Conference are more conflictual than amicable .
From an institutional point of view , this arrangement maintains a balance of power that is fairer to Parliament .
Mr President , I trust that you will once again put the interinstitutional conference on the agenda , in accordance with the wishes of the House .
And that is why the Socialist Group will be voting in favour of the amendment which the Green Group has tabled on this issue .
Mr President , in his introductory remarks Prime Minister Dini stressed how very important it is to fight unemployment .
I fully share this point of view .
However , the fight against unemployment cannot comprise merely fine words , not even if a separate title in the Treaty is devoted to the subject .
The Swedish proposal for an employment union is an example of this .
Originally , this proposal was a proposal to coordinate finance policies and make them more expansionary and to increase demand in times of economic recession .
It was a proposal which really could have had an effect at European level in checking the recession .
Now the proposal has been abandoned totally .
It was not taken further because it conflicts with monetary union and the policy of convergence .
This is thus another example of the fact that today the policy of convergence is the biggest single stumbling block in the fight against unemployment in Western Europe .
This policy must therefore be reviewed , as must the EMU project .
If unemployment could be ' talked out of existence ' we would have got rid of it here a long time ago - but that is not possible .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I will reply briefly to the speeches honourable Members have made and in particular the last speech by Mrs Dury .
I repeat , all that will be the task of the Intergovernmental Conference , with the help and suggestions of Parliament .
I have received eight motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Preparation of CCEE for accession
Madam President , the White Paper on adapting to the internal market , which is the basis for our opinion , provides an excellent indicator for membership of the Union .
It does not contain data on accession , for that is up to the acceding countries themselves .
The speed at which they move towards accession and the ground they have to cover will dictate the time at which they can accede to the Union .
Of course what will happen is that in order to treat everyone at the same level we will have to choose a starting point which is at least symbolically and politically the same one .
For example it could be the Commission offering advice on the various applicant countries , or it could be a symbolic starting time for the beginning of the process .
The path indicated can be travelled voluntarily , nothing is being forced .
We are not even forcing ourselves to do anything .
The White Paper is not a recruiting instrument to enlist newcomers .
Often applicant countries are well on the right tracks .
Sometimes , however , they have a lot of ground to cover .
The rule of law and democracy and the creation of a responsible , well organised society is very much in the interests of the Union and the applicant countries .
By emphasising this we are showing our clear support for democratic processes and forces in the applicant countries .
We want to be an alliance of countries based on the rule of law , with a proper community character , and not just a club of rich countries .
And so I think that we in this House should take a look at the community spirit of applicant countries .
For that could be a very good reason for saying yes or no when it comes to our vote , and we do , after all , have the last word .
The IGC will have to prove that the present Member States take enlargement seriously .
A strengthened Union must at least make it possible for new countries to join . At the end of their journey they should find a house and not a shack awaiting them .
Europe will then remain impotent and be forced to call in the Americans to help solve the slightest conflict .
The report emphasises the need for mutual cooperation between the relevant applicant countries .
It is good that we are getting away from channelling everything through Brussels .
Formerly they had to channel everything through Moscow .
They will have to get used to working together , to trading with each other and to developing together , just as we had to in the Union .
That is also true for cooperation with countries outside the scope of accession .
I am thinking in particular of Ukraine , Belarus , the Russian Federation , Moldova .
We are not forgetting them and stress that trans-border projects with them are also a very important factor in optimising mutual relations .
We also insist that due attention be paid to the environment .
Important aspects are taken up by the many draftsmen of an opinion .
The report contains many sections because there were so many draftsmen of opinions .
It also calls for proper information to be provided for the public in the central and eastern European countries .
They must discover what European integration is all about .
Strangely enough even some of the politicians there have little idea of it .
The enlargement of the European Union is a challenge for the decades ahead .
We now have the opportunity with the applicant countries to do something that for all too long was unthinkable .
Enlargement will take time .
It is not possible , as one of the amendments says , that every time we take a decision we must wait until we have a complete insight into all the financial repercussions of the accession .
It will be a very long time before we have a complete picture and we must not do anything to depart from the strong stance we have taken in favour of enlargement .
There is a whiff of isolationism in the air even in Europe .
But to entrench ourselves smugly in a fortress Europe would be the worst thing we could possibly do .
The applicant countries are carefully watching our reactions and this debate must send out the right signal to them .
That is why I would strongly oppose any manoeuvre to postpone or set up financial barriers , for example , or undermine our determination to work confidently towards enlargement .
Madam President , the White Paper on the preparation of the associated countries for membership of the internal market of the European Union only deals with agricultural aspects in a small way .
To this end the Oostlander report takes substantial note of the European Commission guidelines which are very clear , very precise and do not leave room for subjective interpretation .
The problem for agriculture is a problem of outlook .
Madam President , the Economic Affairs Committee is in favour of enlargement but disagrees with the Oostlander report on its timing .
An overhasty accession , in other words before the applicant countries and the Union itself are ready , is not in the interests of either the applicants or the Union .
First of all the Union must through the IGC re-assert its authority to take decisions and become more democratic .
The applicants must have grown sufficiently strong in terms of their economic and social development to stand up to the tough competition on the internal market without protective measures .
Because unlike the accession of Spain , Portugal and Greece long transition periods are no longer possible .
Now that there are no more border controls there is no longer any scope for a special status on the internal market .
Accession might well take a long time , certainly into the next century .
But in the meantime the applicant countries should not be expected to travel that path empty-handed .
The present trade regulations with central and eastern Europe are hypocritical .
The most difficult and restricted access to the Union is reserved for the most competitive products .
It is no wonder that the European Union has built up a trade surplus .
That must change quickly if the Union wants to remain credible .
Madam President , to deal with energy in the countries of Eastern Europe in just one minute would almost be a record !
But I am going to try and be extremely brief , if not terse , and say simply that the recommendation contained in the Oostlander report touches on two main points .
Firstly , we must take into account that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are heavily dependent on nuclear power .
In this respect , we therefore have two aims .
And , on the other , to envisage a realistic timescale for the possible closure of nuclear power stations that do not comply with basic safety regulations .
The second point in the recommendation is that we must investigate all the different energy sources which might be available in Central and Eastern Europe .
I personally had suggested that the Commission should organize a regional energy conference in these countries , with a view to encouraging diversification .
Madam President , we are aware that the integrationrelated problems of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are great , and that the starting-point of each country is different .
Given that their social structures are diverse , we must look for convergence in terms of increased democracy , the rule of law and responsible administration .
I shall now try to summarize the three areas on which the Committee on External Economic Relations wishes to place particular emphasis .
Firstly , the transposition of the Community 's laws into the national legislation of each of the countries concerned , with particular attention being given to social and environmental requirements , will involve a huge legislative effort .
Similarly , a revision of the common agricultural policy must prevent increased rural desertification and serve to maintain the standard of living of the Union 's farmers .
Madam President , the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights welcomes the White Paper .
A proposal has been made to strengthen the legal system by creating an administrative , organizational and legal infrastructure .
It will not be enough merely to inform the candidate countries of current Community legislation .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin my remarks with three basic observations .
First of all , the gradual eastward enlargement of the European Union is a task of historical necessity .
Secondly , many countries of central and eastern Europe are plagued by indescribable poverty and social deprivation .
Thirdly , many Member States of the Union are also faced with serious social problems .
These observations form the basis of my opinion .
The fundamental requirement is the incorporation into the integration process of the social dimension as reflected in the European social model .
Unfortunately , too little account is taken of this requirement in Mr Oostlander 's report .
This phased plan must include the social dimension .
The Union must assist the candidates for accession to establish and develop socially orientated administrative and organizational infrastructures .
This socially acceptable form of integration will entail extremely high costs both for the Union and for the acceding countries .
That is why the Union has to adopt the appropriate measures in good time .
The necessary integration of the countries of central and eastern Europe must be managed judiciously and in a socially responsible manner .
Otherwise the unwanted social side-effects of such integration could jeopardize the gratifying democratic developments in the applicant countries and their commitment to the idea of a common European home .
We shall have to talk about who is to benefit from the Cohesion Funds and so forth . Economic and social cohesion will , of course , remain our aim .
On that we are agreed . But I feel we have not given enough thought to the level at which this economic and social cohesion is supposed to materialize .
We should remain realistic , and it is essential that we discuss this question of levels .
At the present time , regional policy rather tends to play a minor role in the European Commission .
Finally , let me make a comment that applies not only to regional policy but also to our entire approach to the countries of central and eastern Europe . We always speak of these countries as a single bloc .
Some even call them the CCEEs or PECO . But in reality they are individual states .
They are civilized nations , each with as rich a history as the countries of western Europe . I ask you to keep calling that to mind .
The integration of these states means far more than restructuring national economic systems to adapt them to new legal norms and regulations .
The European Parliament and the Oostlander report have made this point very clearly .
The cultural heritage of Europe must not be considered within the confines of the Union alone .
Such strategies would lead in the medium term to stagnation and decline .
Madam President , it is the historic task of our generation to make Europe whole , to remove the vestiges of 50 years of ideological dictatorship and repression in Central and Eastern Europe .
Yet peace and security also means freedom for crime and terrorism .
Crime has spread in the vacuum left by the dictatorship .
Criminals get through traditional border controls because their organizations have become far more international than the police .
We shall require the new Member States to take action against Mafia activity , drug-related crime , trafficking in human beings , illegal immigration , etc. And we shall make demands of ourselves .
In our own countries we have allowed crime to overwhelm us .
We continually deploy too much manpower at borders , where citizens ' passports and luggage are carefully checked .
It is to no avail and , furthermore , we cooperate far too little to make common cause against international crime .
Madam President , real socialism leaves behind a catastrophic environmental legacy .
The alarming environmental situation is a real danger to public health .
The available know-how must be deployed to ensure that the quality of water , air and soil undergoes constant systematic improvement , not only in western Europe but in the East too .
Safety standards at nuclear plants , as well as the safeguards in place at the numerous storage sites for radioactive waste , are of the utmost importance to the entire global population .
The technical capability of the waste-disposal plants available in individual countries to recycle hazardous waste safely could be used as a criterion in decisions on waste management .
Minimum environmental protection standards should be defined , and states should receive financial and advisory assistance to make those standards attainable .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on Institutional Affairs regards enlargement as both a political necessity and a historic opportunity for Europe .
However , we have stressed the fact that if the European plan is to be viable , the new Treaty must first of all provide for institutional instruments that meet the requirements of an enlarged Union .
Because if institutional reform does not go far enough , it will endanger the very process of building Europe .
We must avoid the risk of Europe being watered down .
Broadening and deepening must be reconciled , through in-depth strengthening and reform of the present institutional framework .
Increased democracy , efficiency , solidarity and transparency must be the key elements in that reform process .
Whether or not the Union is ready for enlargement will depend on the outcome of the IGC .
In this context , the Committee on Institutional Affairs would like to lay down a condition which it believes is unavoidable , namely that the House should deliver a favourable opinion at the end of the negotiations .
Fisheries , as it happens , vary greatly in their importance to the economies of the individual candidate countries .
Nevertheless , there are common features , which demand a uniform approach by the European Union .
The impact of integration on the applicant countries will be considerable .
Our accession strategy must take due account of this fact .
The development of new economic structures and an integration process without traumatic consequences must be our stated objectives .
The present report by Mr Oostlander has been long awaited , not only by us .
These countries are looking hopefully towards a future in the European Union .
In this report we are giving a political signal , telling them that we await them in the Strasbourg family .
But until then there is much to be done by all sides .
These women need to know what they can expect from membership of the European Union .
Efforts must be made from the very outset to ensure that women are not economically and socially marginalized .
In eastern and central Europe many women are trained for technical occupations and are to be found in far greater numbers in the realms of science and research than is the case in western Europe , for example .
Let us ensure that they can assume an increasing amount of political responsibility and can thus effectively play an active part in helping to shape life in the European Union .
Let us support the young democracies by means of reliable partnership and clear messages .
Madam President , I shall restrict myself to two points after congratulating Mr Oostlander on his fine , factual , in-depth report .
The two points I want to make are as follows .
First of all everyone will agree that it is extremely important that we increasingly adopt a pan-European approach to transport .
We see the trouble in our part of Europe caused by not managing to set up a proper transport policy in the European Union .
There we hope , together with the relevant authorities from the eastern European countries , to shape the pan-European transport policy .
The second point I wish to highlight is the area of tension on the requirements necessary for vehicles from eastern European countries operating on our markets .
We all know how important it is to reduce the environmental pollution from traffic .
We lay down stringent requirements on vehicles stationed in western Europe .
We now see an increasing number of vehicles from eastern Europe which do not come anywhere near meeting these same requirements operating on our road network .
I would appreciate hearing what the Commissioner has to say on this area of tension .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , back in the summer of 1993 the European Council decided that those countries of central and eastern Europe which wanted to join the European Union could do so .
The European Council set out the conditions , and quite tough conditions they are too .
The obstacle to accession is not insurmountable , but it is very high .
President Dini stated this morning that preparations for enlargement are also on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference .
He said that the agenda was ambitious and kaleidoscopic , that the Council will present an interim report and that the Madrid decisions are to be implemented .
Those are clear words .
The European Union provided help .
In short , the European Union has made a decisive contribution .
But the really strenuous efforts to date have been made by the governments and more especially by the people in the countries of central and eastern Europe themselves .
Moreover , they have no influence over the essential reform measures that we still have to adopt within the Community , for example in the domains of finance and agriculture .
The countries of central and eastern Europe , however , are not deterred by this , nor should we in the European Parliament be deterred by the magnitude of the tasks facing us .
We want to modernize the European Union .
We want to guarantee stability in Europe , both now and in the long term .
We know that this will not be free of charge , but the cost of non-accession , the cost of instability in Europe and the cost of separate development would be far , far higher .
The future accession of the countries of central and eastern Europe to the European Union is no reason for euphoria and certainly not for arrogance .
The future enlargement of the European Union gives us no cause for excessive optimism , but neither should it cause us undue alarm .
We must set about our task of creating the new Europe of the twentieth century realistically , critically and confidently .
The forthcoming enlargement is part of that task . Our Europe will become what we ourselves make of it .
I have spent considerable time in Central Europe since the revolutions and I believe that we owe our fellow-Europeans the courtesy of the truth .
Enlargement is not only necessary , it is urgent .
It will not come all at once , it will come in waves of countries determined by geopolitics , by economic and political readiness and , only marginally , by economics .
We can help that process by the raft of programmes we already have in place but , most notably , we can help by training their civil servants .
We can hinder that process by failing to put our own House in order over the common agricultural policy and over budget reform .
Above all we can hinder that process by a failure of imagination and by self-absorption .
The financial aspects of enlargement will not be clear for some time yet .
They will depend on the sequence and on the timing of that enlargement and on the progress of the CAP reform .
This is no time for bean counting , it is a time for clarity of intent and honesty of purpose .
Madam President , this debate has assumed a historical dimension , since it is a case of finally turning over one of the darkest pages in our European past .
The countries of Central and Eastern Europe are European countries .
We all share the same values and heritage .
However , 50 years ago they were torn away from Europe and forced into a geopolitical entity where they have never felt at home .
But if we speed up the process , we run a serious risk of causing them to miss their opportunity .
That is why it is important for us to do our best to prepare them for accession .
There are three conditions to be met .
First of all , these countries must share our aims and values .
They must accede in the hope of sharing not only in our prosperity , but in everything that gives meaning to Europe , above all democracy .
Cooperation on a regional level will accustom them to this .
Finally , it is understandable that having had their independence suppressed for 50 years , national security is of great concern to these countries .
As things are at present , NATO represents , in their eyes , the kind of security structure that meets their needs .
Countries which have emerged from the communist bloc must be able to choose freely the type of security structures they wish to have .
To appease Russia , not by giving in to its demands , but through an exhaustive dialogue , is a crucial element in the process of enlargement .
Mr Oostlander 's report sets out very clearly the information on preparing for enlargement , and for this reason , my group will give it its support .
In this resolution Parliament rallies behind the view of the Commission and the Council .
The Commission must present its opinions on all the applicant countries soon after the IGC negotiations .
The applicant countries should be treated on an equal footing and the complete acceptance of the ' acquis communautaire ' should be central to the negotiations .
The Commission 's White Paper is a very useful tool in this exercise .
The preparations in the individual countries will determine the time of accession .
The consensus between the institutions on the procedure to be followed will enable an accession which has been well prepared .
Of course it will cost money , and if you are thinking of costs then I am sure that it will cost more the longer we fail to implement what we have decided .
I could not agree more with Mr Spencer .
There is a lot to be done in economic terms for the central and eastern European countries .
With a little help from the European Union they will be able to make it .
For this adaptation process they have no need of tons of White Papers but concrete aid .
Once the adaptation process has been completed they will be ready to accede .
Madam President , like the rapporteur , we are in principle in favour of enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , since we believe that a united Europe is inconceivable without their participation .
If there is something which we must export to those countries , it is not all-out economic liberalism , but the European social model .
Consequently , there is a need to ensure the preservation of policies such as the CAP - albeit reformed - and the Structural Funds .
We do not wish to see agricultural policies returned to national control , or appropriations for the Structural Funds remaining unaltered , with the same amount of money being distributed between a greater number of countries .
We are therefore in favour of enlargement .
This report represents a contribution - albeit an inadequate one - to that process .
We in the Green Group see eastward enlargement as the current political goal of the European Union .
Enormous historical importance attaches to it .
It could become one of the main prerequisites of a peaceful and democratic Europe .
The countries of eastern Europe in particular entertain high hopes of early accession .
After all , it is not only the countries of central and eastern Europe that have to prepare to move in step with the European Union .
It would be wrong to try and solve the European Union 's own structural problems by extending its market eastwards .
How are these countries to develop the ecological and social aspects of their economies if the so-called conditions of accession are based on an export-orientated development process ?
This would resolve neither the social nor the democratic conflicts in those countries .
Expecting the countries of central and eastern Europe to embrace the principles of the common agricultural policy is a step in the wrong direction .
If they pursue such a policy , they will be faced with a huge employment crisis .
Those countries are neither prepared for such a crisis nor able to overcome it .
The European Union has no option but to prepare for this enlargement by reforming its structural and agricultural policies .
I also believe it is wrong to seek to develop a common security policy without preventive mechanisms and without the OSCE .
This is a major flaw in the Oostlander report .
Mr Oostlander , whom I congratulate on the quality of his work , has decided to extend the scope of his report .
He has presented us with an overall political picture of enlargement , the reasons behind it , its effects , and the conditions which have to be fulfilled in order for enlargement to be successful .
The 15 opinions of the specialist committees have enabled us to cover a wide spectrum of issues .
In general , I am in favour of Mr Oostlander 's report .
It is constructive , positive and does not discriminate between the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe , all of whom are starting out from the same point .
However , it could perhaps have placed more emphasis on the considerable opportunity which enlargement represents for ourselves .
But I would earnestly ask that mentioning pre-conditions should not make people think that we are , in fact , in no hurry to throw our doors open to new residents .
Only then will they be able to summon up the energy needed to justify the tremendous effort that is and will continue to be required from their people .
Just think of the progress already made : for example , a 7 % annual increase in GNP in both Poland and the Czech Republic .
Political action thrives on goals , hope , and even dreams .
For those of a more serious or technical turn of mind , there is the White Paper itself .
The Commission has carried out an excellent piece of work , which is already proving useful in planning the reforms that are being carried out in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
I was in Poland recently and can confirm this .
Naturally , this White Paper on the internal market will be supplemented by others .
This subsequent work will allow progress to be assessed , but above all it will encourage the efforts made by the applicant countries , as well as ourselves .
Nobody puts a question mark against the White Paper 's and the report 's principal political objective : peace and stability in Europe .
But the question is whether the means to achieve this are the right ones .
The critical point is that the idea is not to provide a basis for free dialogue and free economic relations between independent nations .
The plan is for our eastern neighbours to be subjected to the conditions laid down by the European Union .
The keyword is adaptation , which actually means , in practice , submission .
It is a tragic mistake , not made any better by the report 's highflown language which includes an innovation called the social market economy .
I will admit that social market economy is linguistically creative , but unfortunately politically impossible .
I was also struck by the report 's obsession with economics , when what Europe needs is political will .
It is up to us , in company with our comrades in the East , to seek a third way , one far removed from socialism as well as capitalism , both of which generate poverty and social injustice .
We should make that clear to everyone .
The Committee on Budgets did not submit any amendments to the report for the simple reason that we are awaiting the outcome of a public hearing next month on the cost of enlargement .
We would have much preferred that the Oostlander report waited until after that hearing or , indeed , that the hearing be brought forward .
I think that is to some extent a condemnation of the timetabling of Parliament 's business .
But here we are , we are left with the report , and the fact that the Budgets Committee has not yet had its hearing .
I do not take exception to what Tom Spencer said : I take it as a compliment when I am criticized in this respect .
But Tom said something about the Budgets Committee wanting to spoil this report because it is involved in bean counting .
One of the questions we have to ask , quite frankly , is how many beans are the Member States prepared to pay for enlargement ?
Until we get an answer to that , we can pontificate as much as we want about enlargement and will be giving a false impression until we know the cost .
Parliament 's position on enlargement deserves something far better than a report of this kind .
At least it deserves a committee in its own right , as we had with East German accession .
We should not be giving those applicant countries false hope until we know the cost .
Madam President , the Council has decided that the European Union is to be enlarged to include the states of central and eastern Europe , and the European Parliament supports that decision .
It represents both a historic challenge and an opportunity for all concerned .
For the first time , the states within the boundaries of Europe can become a community devoted to peace .
The closer we come to this step , however , the more discussion there will be of the details of enlargement .
The White Paper is a compendium of rules governing the working of the European internal market , and in the event of accession the candidates will also have to base their policies on the White Paper .
So that proper preparation can take place and excessive expectations and misleading arguments can be avoided , this subject must be systematically and seriously discussed in all its aspects .
It is clear , and has often been said , that while the European Union has to move , so too must the candidate states .
This report by Mr Oostlander can only be the starting-point for a thorough discussion .
As a budget expert , I should like to add that the Committee on Budgets , as Barry Wynn pointed out , will contribute to a wide-ranging discussion of this matter .
On 7 May the committee will stage a hearing on the financial aspects of enlarging the European Union , which will culminate in the use of its right of initiative to table a report .
They are also meant to demonstrate that Parliament has already begun its work towards this end and intends to pursue it resolutely .
Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report which can at least be called comprehensive .
It tackles many aspects of enlargement of the Union , including the budget , education , social affairs , the second and third pillars .
But in my view the Commission 's White Paper is not about that .
The White Paper is about preparing the central and eastern European countries for their integration into the Union 's internal market .
But our proposals are important for the integration of applicant countries into the Union 's internal market .
Among other things they include the tremendous legislative task facing the countries of central and eastern Europe to adapt their national legislation to the internal market .
It goes without saying that we shall have to help them in this process .
My conclusion is simple .
Madam President , there is no doubt that enlargement is being promoted by the dominant powers in the European Union , for ideological and geopolitical reasons .
I think today 's debate proves that the European Parliament too subscribes to that kind of thinking .
How can our peoples pretend to adopt that policy when its consequences for their countries and for themselves are unknown ?
I do not think that anyone gives us the right to teach democracy to any of Europe 's peoples .
Madam President , the enlargement of the European Union towards the east is written in the stars , and is therefore as inevitable as it is inviolable .
This is a fact of life which no Member State can deny .
Nevertheless , the negotiations which will begin after the Intergovernmental Conference must concentrate on establishing the conditions that are required to make integration a politically constructive process .
However , according to present studies , it would not be in the interests of either the applicant countries or ourselves if accession were to take place before 2005 .
Hungary , Poland , the Czech Republic and Slovenia have all made tremendous efforts in order to join the Union .
We must not deceive them , and must therefore show , without resorting to either populism or paternalism , that we have the political will to include them among our number .
That is the challenge which is facing us .
I believe , and I shall focus my speech today on this , that in addition to the economic and political aspects security must also play a major part in the debate on enlargement .
But nobody can deny that the enlargement of NATO in particular will meet with strong resistance from the Russian Federation .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to commend Mr Oostlander on his excellent in-depth report .
However , I cannot conceal a slight feeling of dissatisfaction which it is beyond the power of Mr Oostlander alone to overcome .
This is a great pity , since our work needs such a perspective .
We are taking part in a historic adventure .
The 15 present Member States of the Union have practically all waged war on each other during the course of the last seven or eight centuries .
The arrival on the scene of other nations provides a chance for reconciliation in a continent that has experienced more wars than almost any other .
Furthermore , history contains no case of a great power that has been forged other than by conquering its future vassal states .
I would also stress that the final choice of dates does not lie with the European Parliament , but with the Intergovernmental Conference .
I do not think it would be wise to take any risks , however small , in this respect .
We ask you to heed our message , Commissioner .
Since we have listed figures , doubts , uncertainties , and conditions , we should also mention motives , which could turn out to be noble and generous .
We are embarking on the greatest political adventure that mankind has ever witnessed .
Madam President , as a long-time student of the enlargement question , I must confess to being slightly bemused by the debate going on about this particular round of enlargement .
I found myself warning that it was not as simple as that .
But we have now got ourselves into a position where everybody is throwing up their arms in horror at the enormous difficulties , and that is before we have even started the negotiations .
I find myself having to play down those difficulties .
As the last speaker on behalf of Parliament I ought to reiterate some basic points .
Firstly , it is not a question of if we enlarge , it is a question of when we enlarge .
The European Union is open to any state which meets the basic criteria .
In addition , to the Central and Eastern European countries we have long said that if they threw off the yoke of dictatorship we would welcome them into our family .
If we reverse that message now we run the risk of undermining all the reforms which have taken place at great pain in Central and Eastern Europe .
To underestimate those difficulties would be ultimately to undermine the enlargement process .
An overhasty enlargement would actually do more harm than good .
We cannot pretend that these problems do not exist .
We cannot constantly be operating under the tyranny of the Committee on Budgets in the European Parliament .
I welcome the White Paper because it is a start in addressing the practical issues in relation to enlargement .
At the end of the day enlargement is a political question , it is a question of political will by political leaders .
Do we want to make it happen ?
There is also a question of political acceptability to the citizens of the European Union and to the citizens of the Central and Eastern European countries .
Unless they are prepared to accept the conditions we negotiate , it will not happen .
We should bear that in mind in everything we say and do leading up to ultimate enlargement in the next century .
May I first of all congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Oostlander , on his comprehensive report and the great deal of work he has put into it .
It is a historic opportunity , a point which has been made several times this morning .
We ought to seize this opportunity , which is not easy at times , but the political decision taken at the European Council in Copenhagen in 1993 was clear .
The Member States decided to further in this way the political , economic and social development of all peoples in Europe .
In that decision security policy played a determining role .
A successful Intergovernmental Conference is in the view of the Commission essential for enlargement .
We in the Commission know that Parliament agrees with us here .
Mr Oostlander 's report also makes this quite clear .
You will recall the promise given to you by the Council during the last enlargement .
The European Council in Madrid in December proclaimed a new phase in the process of enlargement of the Union and was challenged to define the procedure and the timetable for its preparation .
The Commission was instructed to produce a report on certain aspects of enlargement .
It has to further evaluate the consequences of enlargement on community policy , with particular reference to agriculture and structural policy .
The European Council will resume its examination on the basis of these reports .
The Commission services continue to analyze the consequences of enlargement on the Union 's policy as well as the situation in each of the applicant countries .
These opinions will be accompanied by a so-called synthesis document in which the main horizontal questions relevant to the enlargement and the prospect of accession negotiations will be addressed .
The Commission will then produce a statement on the financial framework , after 1999 , which takes account of the possible enlargement .
The Council will then decide on the start of accession negotiations in the light of all these reports .
With regard to Cyprus and Malta , as you know , the decision was taken to start negotiations six months after the conclusion of the IGC .
But definitive decisions have yet to be taken .
That is the situation at the moment and I intend , and the Commission intends , to involve the European Parliament as closely as possible in this process .
It is only by working in harmony with the other institutions that this ambitious task can be done .
We need your help and advice and this report from Mr Oostlander forms a good point of departure .
More specifically with regard to the implementation of the White Paper considerable progress has been made with preparing the associated countries to integrate into the internal market .
This service will soon be expanded to include experts in the field of the internal market from national administrations and from private bodies in the Member States .
I shall now turn briefly to the specific paragraphs of the motion for a resolution .
We fully support the broad outlines of the motion for a resolution .
That is the Commission 's starting point for its future activities .
As I have already said , the Commission totally endorses that view .
In various paragraphs you call for more White Papers to be presented on various subjects .
I would , however , point out that pursuant to the European Council in Madrid the Commission has been instructed to present various reports .
In addition to the detailed opinions on the applications for accession the Commission will also produce a synthesis document on the enlargement .
I have already mentioned that .
So the Commission has already a large number of reports to work on .
Finally , Madam President , paragraph 14 calls on the Commission to give the candidate countries the necessary assurances regarding their accession to the Union by drawing up minimum criteria which must be complied with .
Secondly , the existence of a functioning market economy and thirdly the ability to withstand the pressure of competition and market forces within the Union .
We believe that clearly describes the criteria .
This important debate will undoubtedly be followed by many more .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place in a moment .
Votes
Before this roll-call vote is held , I should simply like to point out that the amendment relates only to the figures .
Rejecting it would therefore amount to contesting the figures , which at present are not in dispute .
After the vote on the amendments :
We are calling for more time for a strategic debate and hence for referral back to committee .
I thank those Members who are applauding in advance what I am about to say .
I should like to say to Mrs Aelvoet that , despite the fact that we are on opposite sides of the House , I fully support her proposal for referral back to committee .
I do not agree with her when she calls for the European Development Fund to be integrated into the general budget , since that would mean that the ACP countries would receive less money .
I do agree with her , however , when she says that the debate was not conducted properly and that we are sending a bad signal to the ACP countries .
It is not the question of the integration of the EDF into the budget or otherwise which determines our rejection of this report , but the fact that we are sending a bad signal to the ACP countries .
To refuse the discharge would be to call into question our cooperation with those countries and our will to continue that cooperation .
It would be to exploit the issue of budgetizing the EDF , through an institutional ploy which we reject , to the detriment of our relations with the ACP countries .
I am therefore in favour of referring the report back to committee .
Mr President , the proposal to refer this back to committee is totally inappropriate , particularly for the reasons given .
It was a perfectly proper debate .
I can think of no circumstances less appropriate to refer a matter back to the committee .
This House should reject this proposal .
( Applause )
( Parliament rejected the proposal to refer the matter back to committee )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Mr President , on a point of order , I should like to move an amendment to the order of voting .
In the voting list the amendment I am tabling on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party comes before the amendment tabled by the Green Group in the European Parliament .
The Greens ' amendment , however , goes further .
Both amendments concern research with foetal tissue .
The Greens reject such research outright .
Good reasons may be found for that , but it does not reflect the view expressed by Parliament in other resolutions .
I believe we can then carry this Amendment No 3 together , because Parliament has already adopted it once .
But let me add that some groups would like a separate vote on the passage concerning somatic gene therapy at the end of Amendment No 3 .
If it is still possible , I should like to ask for that to be arranged , but the more important point to me is the voting sequence .
Mr Liese , I cannot agree with you .
The order in which the secretariat has prepared the vote is the logical and correct order .
Mr President , you certainly answered my point very clearly and assuredly .
I should just like to know what makes you so sure that a total ban on research in a particular field is less far-reaching than the subjection of such research to certain safety regulations .
At any rate , I stand by my opinion and call for the vote to be taken first on the amendment tabled by the Green Group in the European Parliament and then on our amendment .
It is not for the Chair to judge these things .
All we are doing in terms of setting the structure for the vote is to follow the logical , chronological order of the amendments .
The House is sovereign in terms of the decisions it makes .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Mr President , this is a very minor amendment . I understand it has fairly wide-spread support across the House .
I should just like to read the first line : ' Notes in this respect that measures to promote employment should ... ' .
( The oral amendment was accepted )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Before we take the final vote I should like to thank the rapporteur for making my job in the Chair easier than it could have been .
It was a very complicated vote .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Mr President , I ask your indulgence to invite my colleagues who have not yet signed the declaration on autism to do so .
Over 100 colleagues have signed it in the last two days .
I wish to invite the rest to sign it as soon as possible .
Under the Rules , you cannot so inform the House but you have anyway .
Parliament 's decision is fully in keeping with the conclusions of the Barcelona Conference .
It is time to restore balance to the European Union 's cooperation with its partners on the other shores of the Mediterranean .
Furthermore , with regard to the fisheries sector , we must welcome the financial protocol annexed to the agreement , which amounts to ECU 500 million over four years .
I personally support the breakdown between four actions : financial compensation , development programmes , scientific research and training programmes .
The aid granted must serve to promote employment and development .
The European Union is showing solidarity in an important sector of the Moroccan economy .
This solidarity must also be displayed in other sectors .
A vote in favour is virtually certain , but we shall have to wait a few months before giving a boost to renewed general cooperation .
That has been achieved .
Who could possibly object to better coordination in health policy ?
Yet we voted against the proposal and did so for the following reasons .
It is obvious that collecting data serves a wider purpose than merely evaluating the present community policy .
The background is the continuing harmonisation of the health systems themselves .
That goal is now just a step too far .
If these systems grow towards each other , then that is all very well . But if Brussels deliberately dictates that path , then that is an undesirable development in our view .
Mr President , for some years now the European Union has had a number of public health programmes in an attempt to bring Europe closer to the man in the street .
Even European programmes to combat cancer , aids and smoking have difficulty resisting the test of subsidiarity .
The value of a European approach is in serious doubt .
The problem facing a policy on public health in many countries is the inability to pay for care .
Costs have soared through the roof .
But the question of how much money should be paid for health care should be answered by the people involved .
It is a national affair .
Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament have no business saying anything here .
If the national authorities can hardly come to grips with it then nothing will be gained by tackling it on a wider scale .
Europe should not get over ambitious by trying to manage public health policy .
Even the very definition of a hospital bed creates problems .
A European monitoring system is out of the question .
In my opinion the development of a worthwhile European policy on public health is a dream .
Let Europe concentrate its forces on other affairs .
This is what is proposed in the Commission 's document , which the rapporteur has skilfully amended .
The fundamental choices which the Member States will be obliged to make are important and will have a bearing on the future of the European project itself .
The European Parliament had intended to propose the establishment of a genuine European Health Observatory , along the lines of those being set up in other fields .
However , the majority in the Council preferred to restrict the programme to one of simple coordination - exploiting , as usual , the different traditions and reservations of the health sector and the budgetary constraints in this area .
The outline of the health monitoring system proposed by the Commission is certainly somewhat blurred , but whatever form this new instrument takes , we wish it to be practicable and effective .
The European Parliament also wished , in general terms , health professionals , NGOs and the paramedical sector as a whole to be more closely associated with the definition of the broad outlines of health policy .
I am not entirely convinced that this wish was taken into account by the Commission .
It is time , therefore , to ensure the involvement of the citizens and health professionals in the taking of tomorrow 's major decisions .
In the Commission 's own terms , the proposed health monitoring system is designed to :
I repeat : medicine in the twenty-first century must be more resolutely focused on prevention .
We have much to gain from this , and let us make no mistake : a well-managed prevention policy will enable us to safeguard the integrity of our endangered healthcare systems .
By spending in advance , we spend less later on .
If operations were carried out as soon as the warning signs appeared , there would be fewer deaths and tragedies .
I hope that this Commission proposal - even if I do not believe that it is as accomplished as the House would have wished - will constitute a first step towards establishing this medicine of tomorrow .
Leopardi report ( A4-0091 / 96 )
Once again , we add our voice to this positive request .
Furthermore , the national health cards are subject to the standards and criteria governing information / registration applicable in the Member State in question , which restricts the scope for misusing information .
Moreover , the report is an example of the numerous own-initiative reports from the EP in the health sector , which have no overall strategic basis , and cut down the time available for actual legislative work .
This would represent a genuine step forward in making the daily lives of our citizens easier .
This idea has been on the table since 1981 , and Parliament has adopted a number of resolutions on the subject .
Now , pursuant to Article 138b of the EC Treaty , it can request the submission of a corresponding legislative proposal .
Two issues , in my view , are particularly important .
The first concerns respect for the confidentiality of the information contained on the cards , and the confidence that citizens can place in the competent authorities wherever they go .
And the second concerns acceptance of the card throughout Europe .
This will inevitably be a long-term enterprise , especially in that it involves an area where the Community 's competence is limited .
It is not the view of the Danish Social Democrats that the EU should pursue an actual health policy .
The drawing up of health policies should continue to be a task carried out as closely as possible to the citizen , with the public exercising the maximum influence .
Mr Leopardi 's report on a health card would require resources which cannot be justified by the card 's potential use .
The card would have to be used throughout the health system , which would require the procurement of electronic equipment and the electronic input of data .
A number of people would have this card issued individually , and there would have to be training on a massive scale in the use of cards and equipment .
In addition there are the running costs , altogether a very costly business .
The advantages are not so great as they appear to be at first sight .
Practical , security and ethical problems , together with the fact that only Europe is covered , restrict the scope for its use .
On the basis of a medical technology assessment , this report would inevitably be rejected .
The report should in other respects be viewed in the context of many MPs ' wish for a federal health policy , in which health costs are covered by the EU .
However , there are also very positive aspects to the proposal , including easier access to treatment abroad , but significantly better provision can be made for those aspects in other ways .
One of the aims of the Cabrol report on blood safety and self-sufficiency in blood is to create an internal market in blood and blood products .
This may conflict with the Danish wish for national self-sufficiency and the body of voluntary donors which we have .
The Popular Movement cannot vote in favour of this report , in that we consider it to be far too narrowly conceived .
We do not want that .
The individual Member States should continue to be able to pursue an independent health policy .
We find that a health card containing information about sexual orientation , for example , is quite unacceptable .
And we also believe that it should be voluntary to have a health card or not .
Wynn report ( A4-0098 / 96 )
Mr President , our group did not vote in favour of Mr Wynn 's report granting the Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget for 1994 .
I should first like to make some remarks concerning the procedure .
As I pointed out yesterday in the general debate , eight separate reports were the subject of a joint debate .
Taking into account the breaks in the sitting , this debate lasted less than two hours .
There were very few contributors other than the main speakers from the Committee on Budgets .
Consequently , the debate received little input , and today very little time was devoted to the votes .
I note that no amendments were tabled .
So there will be virtually no explanations of vote on this subject .
This is revealing , in my view , of a negative trend which I must condemn .
In view of the fact that the Committee on Budgets is failing to assume its responsibilities , therefore , we voted against the Wynn report .
Wynn report ( A4-0096 / 96 )
And I would point out that the Foundation 's spending - ECU 810 000 , or 0.04 % of the EDF - was the pretext used for refusing the discharge .
That is the only irregularity .
And I accept that it is an irregularity .
Are the disastrous political consequences of a negative decision on the EDF 's accounts not likely to undermine the ACP countries ' confidence in the Member States ' commitment towards them ?
The institutional ploy in which the majority of Members are engaging is unacceptable .
It discredits this Parliament .
We cannot use a report , regardless of its substance , as a pretext for engaging in deliberations on structural or institutional problems .
We did this with regard to loans to South Africa .
Now we are doing it again with regard to cooperation with the ACP countries .
Our group refuses to participate in this institutional ploy , this continuing squabble .
It is for this reason that it did not vote in favour of Mr Wynn 's report .
There is no real democratic control over the utilization of the European Development Fund , whilst in the Member States , development aid expenditure is controlled by the national parliaments .
This is an area in which the usefulness of pursuing policies jointly under a Community procedure has not been demonstrated .
The undersigned agree with the Court of Auditors ' criticisms of the shortcomings of the European Development Fund 's management and the minimal scrutiny to which the Fund 's payments are subject .
We are also critical of the lack of logic in the legal and juridical framework governing the EDF .
However , unlike the report we do not believe that Parliament should be given increased budgetary or legislative powers .
The EDF should continue to be managed by the Member States and audited by nationally appointed auditors .
Discharge should be granted by the national parliaments , which are the bodies with most democratic legitimacy .
The ARE Group 's decision to vote against granting the Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Development Funds for the 1994 financial year is based on the following two reasons :
This is hardly reassuring . In fact , waste is inherent in a Community budgetary procedure that is characterized by irresponsibility .
Firstly , there is the irresponsibility due to the financial structure . Europe is a suction and force pump .
80 % of expenditure is managed by the Member States . In these circumstances , does it make sense for it to pass through Brussels ?
Should the subsidiarity principle not lead to part of Community expenditure being relinquished ?
The Cohesion Fund , the Structural Funds and certain internal policies are designed to create a support base for the European Community . But creating support bases and budgetary discipline are , by their very nature , mutually exclusive .
Poggiolini report ( A4-0051 / 96 )
We are all aware that the population of the European Union is living longer and ageing .
We must welcome this phenomenon , which is proof of the constant improvement of living and hygiene conditions .
Nevertheless , we must also prepare for its many consequences .
The increase in lifespan is leading to a rise in the incidence of age-related diseases - in particular , Alzheimer 's disease .
We cannot ignore the fact that by the year 2000 , around 8 million European citizens will be affected .
The consequences of this irreversible degenerative disease are above all human .
The progressive alienation and physical decline of an elderly person cause immense suffering to both the patient and his or her family and carers .
Given the extent of Alzheimer 's disease , however , the amount of financial resources and medical staff devoted to tackling it are totally inadequate .
I unreservedly support the rapporteur 's call on the Commission to implement a programme of measures to combat this disease .
Similarly , I would urge the Commission to draw up , in collaboration with the Member States , a white paper on the different approaches to Alzheimer 's disease in the European Union .
Let us enrich our collective knowledge with the experiences of the different Member States .
Let us join our efforts to establish the specific causes of this disease .
Failing to spend sufficient money on research into the disease is bound to mean having to spend more money on dealing with its consequences .
In addition to this essential but futile humanitarian expenditure , therefore , let us make a positive investment in eradicating this scourge - God willing - once and for all .
The fact that an own-initiative report has been drawn up on Alzheimer 's disease is not wrong in itself , but why this disease in particular ?
What about all the other rare diseases where there is a need for greater research ?
It would have been a better idea in the first place to have devised a common strategy for rare diseases and , in that context , discuss the priorities for Community action .
The incidence of Alzheimer 's disease in advanced countries , where it is mainly concentrated , is already high .
The absolute number of victims is already considerable and comparable with that of other virus diseases , such as AIDS .
Could this be mainly because it is believed that Alzheimer 's disease affects mainly the aged ?
So far there have only been research programmes of limited scope , while the financing of those programmes falls far short of the associated scientific and social interest .
' Senile dementia ' , as it is known , is not the target of a single expenditure programme by the welfare organizations .
However , in the immediate future , finance must also be provided for research on the prevention , diagnosis and treatment of the disease .
Cabrol report ( A4-0094 / 96 )
Ladies and gentlemen , what a long way we have come !
We can finally dare to talk of carrying out tests and telling infected donors not to give any more blood - although you would think that was the least that should be done .
We can finally dare to talk about promoting the use of self-transfusion , something which until very recently was prohibited , for reasons which in fact were far more ideological than practical .
Our reasoned words were met with nothing but scorn .
Today , those who contradicted us stand accused of the infamous charge of contaminating the population .
I have already had an opportunity - yesterday evening , in plenary - to express my support for the Commission communication and Mr Cabrol 's report .
Today , I wish to reiterate the importance of ensuring the safety of blood products through the testing of donations and the application of stringent circulation and storage requirements .
I also wish to stress the need for a large-scale information and awareness campaign on blood and blood donation , with a view to achieving self-sufficiency in Europe .
That must serve as a lesson for the future and prompt us to introduce even more stringent safety requirements .
This debate on the safety of transfusions and self-sufficiency in blood and blood products raises an important social issue .
A choice must be made between the defence of moral principles and the pursuit of profit .
The House was able to highlight these dangers during a special debate in September 1993 .
The Commission was required to take account of Parliament 's concerns in its communication of December 1994 , which is the subject of this report .
Our group 's position is based on an inviolable basic principle : that the human body is not a commodity .
We believe that the human body and any organs or substances obtained from it are inalienable and non-marketable .
Voluntary blood donor associations have long been pressing the Commission to take action in this important area of public health .
Blood , and the products obtained and extracted from it , are extremely important therapeutic substances by means of which medical science offers substantial help in both acute and chronic diseases .
The methods used up till now must be re-examined as responsibly and sensitively as possible , as well as the rules relating to the system of blood donation and its safe therapeutic use in patients .
Current regulations involve omissions and inadequacies that are responsible for the results of the practices in force for the production and disposal of blood products .
The development of voluntary blood donation must be the most important contribution to covering the demand for blood used to cater for the therapeutic needs of patients .
However , that source must go together with reliable and responsible clinical and laboratory support .
Turin European Council
Widening must therefore be reconciled with deepening - but how will this be possible whilst respecting the fundamental principle of maintaining a single institutional framework ?
In these circumstances , we are not surprised to find , in the summary of the European Council 's conclusions , a lack of any clear vision of Europe 's future .
Will the Intergovernmental Conference succeed in reconciling these two conflicting demands ?
However , the IGC is burdened with an even more serious problem : that of the single currency .
Officially , the conference is not meant to be addressing this issue , since the decision has already been taken .
In reality , however , the preparations for the single currency are bringing to light a number of serious institutional problems which remain to be resolved .
Mr Hänsch himself drew attention to this in his speech at the Turin summit .
I shall quote him : ' Europe 's currencies will be brought within the Community domain .
Economic policy , however , will not .
It is not good for this situation to continue .
The Union needs global macroeconomic management . '
It must simply be able to exercise better the competences which it already enjoys . '
The contradiction reflected by these two quotes is common to all the Union 's institutions .
One statement derives from the need to respect public opinion , the other from the need to support the single currency .
Following the IGC , one of the two - respect for public opinion , or support for the single currency - must prevail .
We do not want such a state .
At Maastricht , we paid dearly for the agreement of Portugal , Spain , Greece and Ireland , with the creation of the Cohesion Fund .
This year , it is the United Kingdom with which we shall have to compromise .
The spectre of mad cow disease hung over the Turin summit .
The Member States have agreed to pay 70 % of the cost of slaughtering old British cows at the end of their productive life .
This is a wasted effort , however , since the British Government is already contesting the legality of the ban on its beef exports at the European Court of Justice .
And , to cap it all , the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference will have to wait until after the general election is held in the United Kingdom !
Whatever next !
If the revision of the Treaties were to be the key issue in a democratic election enabling European citizens to express their views , that really would be something .
Once again , hidden behind the great plans and fine speeches lie quibbling , horse-trading , undeclared aims and financial designs .
No : whatever clothes you try to dress this monster in , we want nothing to do with such a Europe .
The Intergovernmental Conference , in its present form , is in danger of becoming a hotch-potch .
In the absence of a clear analysis of the world situation , there is no real principle underpinning the conference .
Let us take the case of the fight against unemployment and external policy .
The reality which we are refusing to see and put a name to is the following .
Today , there is only one major power left in the world : the United States .
Having played a decisive role in the victory in the Second World War , in 1989 , the United States won the cold war with the Soviet Union .
The United States is in a position to lay down the law to the international community .
In economic terms , this is the law of unrestricted freedom of trade , from which , for historical reasons , the big American companies are able to profit most .
The free trade imposed by the United States calls into question the various social protection systems which exist in Europe .
Because it will not call into question the ' leadership ' of the United States - which would not prevent friendship with the American people , however - the European Union is subject to this global law .
As a result , it cannot tackle unemployment at its root , and it is proposing no more than stop-gap measures and limited adjustments .
In political terms , Europe is obliged to support the establishing of the new world order as defined by the United States .
And what are Europe 's plans for the world order ?
They do not exist .
They would have to be defined on the basis of national realities , and we are a long way from that .
In these circumstances , the IGC will bring no improvement , other than in procedural details .
The European Union seems to be afflicted with the same disease as Byzantium at the time of its decline : a lack of self-assertion and a lack of courage .
It is in this light that I cast my vote on the joint motion for a resolution .
We want the EU to continue to be an organisation for civil cooperation between independent states .
We also believe that the Intergovernmental Conference should be urged by the European Parliament to take up the issue of the EMU convergence criteria and recognise the link between unemployment and those criteria .
Clearly , these legitimate demands are in conflict with those of the postMaastricht European muddle which the IGC is preparing for us .
In any event , the National Front demands that the peoples of Europe should be directly consulted in a referendum to decide on the approval or rejection of Maastricht II .
Much less technocracy and much more direct democracy can only benefit Europe .
Increasing unemployment and poverty in Europe will not be solved by a further expansion of the EU 's political influence .
Increasing supranationalism within the Union will only remove political decision-makers still further from the people .
Democracy becomes difficult to discern when , because of ambiguous political structures , decision-makers at national or European level can blame the problems faced by society on one another .
It is my firm belief that the European Union should be a forum for cooperation between sovereign states in which ultimate accountability to the voters lies with the national parliaments .
I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will produce a result which makes the European Union simpler and less bureaucratic .
A large majority of our group could not support the resolution because it falls far short of the reforms that are needed in the EU today .
In this way it has squandered another opportunity to make good its own claim to an active role in the development of the reform process .
Alongside that failure , any individual textual nuances over which we might quibble pale into insignificance .
But a genuine process of democratic reform of the EU is obviously still a long way off !
Oostlander report ( A4-101 / 96 )
Nevertheless , the diversity of these countries and their differences - not least economic and social - from the Member States of the Union will make this process a difficult one .
How can we accomplish it quickly ?
What kind of institutions will enable us to assimilate these disparate nations ?
It assumes that the countries of Central and Eastern should accede to the Community en bloc , with institutional unity , and only some slight differences as regards their respective speeds .
With these words , the Oostlander report aims in particular at the extension of qualified majority voting , which is meant to facilitate the functioning of an enlarged Europe .
We might well ask how .
In reality , the only solution is to abandon the dogma of institutional unity and accept variable geometry .
This also means that we must opt for a European partnership of nations , rather than a federal Europe .
This will enable us to welcome the countries of Central and Eastern Europe more effectively and more quickly .
Mr President , I subscribe entirely to the views expressed by my colleagues , and I shall therefore confine myself to making three specific points .
Secondly , Mr Oostlander 's report makes frequent reference to democratic legitimacy , the rule of law , and democracy - I am thinking in particular of paragraph 18 .
I fear , Mr President , that this idea is more of a slogan than a proven fact .
This tendency is to be found in the Oostlander report on which I am making this explanation of vote together with my colleague Mr Van der Waal , on whose behalf I also speak .
In practical terms this means putting a brake on a speedy expansion towards the east .
That is unacceptable to us on both moral and security policy grounds .
Furthermore we regret that the report pays no attention to the geographical and cultural confines of Europe .
That is necessary to prevent any arbitrary accession of new countries .
Any attempt at enlargement must be directed at countries which belong to the sphere of European culture and influence of western Christianity including the reformation .
Good neighbourliness is important , especially in international relations , but before one invites the neighbours into one 's own house one should have a good think .
Proponents of enlargement always assume that enlargement will benefit both the present and the future member states .
That is undoubtedly true .
Just think of our domestic and foreign security and of democratic stability .
But the fact that there is a price to be paid and that there may even be drawbacks is often passed over or even forgotten .
This is partly because the consequences of this kind of accession are not clear or are inadequately recognised .
What will happen to decision-taking , to the institutions , to the community budget in general and the budget headings for the cohesion funds and structural funds in particular ?
I am not prepared either as a politician or as a private citizen to write a blank cheque .
We would also be wrong to raise hopes in the relevant countries which might not be fulfilled .
Despite the German wish to welcome Poland and the Czech Republic just now . Despite the Swedish wish to allow the Baltic Sea countries to accede .
Self-interest is a poor adviser in this kind of negotiation .
In the final analysis we are talking about extending the European Union and not replacing it with a large free trade area with a dwindling community pillar and a dominant intergovernmental pillar .
We , the undersigned , have voted for the report .
It is also very important , as the report says , that those countries which elect not to join should be granted good conditions for trade and cooperation with the EU .
The authors of the report consider that enlargement to the east is undoubtedly possible in theory , but will be far more difficult in practice .
In fact , it seems as if Europe is opening its borders to the south , but closing them to the east .
Given the uncertain prospects , and the indecisiveness - not to say positive lack of commitment - on the part of our countries , they appear to be making all the effort .
In this context , it is important to point out , firstly , that the principle of the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe has been established and must remain so .
We must avoid breaking the camel 's back by imposing unrealistic preconditions on the applicant countries , or indulging in petty accounting .
The main obstacle to the smooth progress of a transition which should logically end in accession is , to my mind , the over-cautiousness of the Union Member States .
Enlargement has a price , that cannot be denied .
But the price of our indifference and selfishness will undoubtedly be far higher , because they threaten to deprive the countries of Central and Eastern Europe of political prospects which are essential to the success of their transition .
The report on the Central and Eastern European countries ' participation in cooperation in the internal market is very well thought out .
The rapporteur deserves praise for his excellent analysis of the problems to be solved as part of the preparations for the forthcoming enlargement of the EU .
It does not automatically mean that the new Member States should , or will be able , to accede to the EU en bloc .
The applicant countries are very different , which can duly be taken into account only by conducting accession negotiations with each country separately .
For the same reason , the duration of these negotiations as well as the timing of the individual applicant country 's accession to the EU , may well vary considerably .
It is important that the negotiations with the countries of Eastern and Central Europe which have applied for membership should begin simultaneously .
It is extremely important that the process leading to possible membership is conducted democratically and openly , preferably concluding with a referendum .
Each country should of course decide for itself how it wishes to cooperate with the EU .
Since the Oostlander report does not satisfy our preconditions in the slightest we are unable to vote in favour of it .
Tackling the problems and challenges faced by modern society requires the development of exchanges and cooperation in every sphere .
In this context , I am in favour of the enlargement of the Union to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
This must provide an opportunity to encourage the development of a democratic Europe , based on economic and social progress and forming part of a common vision of international relations .
Furthermore , in just a few years , the economic shock therapy experienced by these countries has given rise to considerable social inequalities .
It would be useful , therefore , to carry out a detailed analysis , on a case-by-case basis , of the political , economic and social implications of enlargement for the applicant countries .
I support an approach which is quite different from that of placing workers and economies in competition with each other .
Such an approach must be based on the aspirations of the peoples concerned , and on the promotion of human potential , employment , democracy , peace and security .
The campaign for disarmament and demilitarization is thus an essential aspect of our security on the European continent .
The bloc mentality and military designs of organizations such as NATO or the Western European Union will have no place in the Europe of the future .
Nevertheless , it does also contain dangers .
For all these reasons , I have abstained from voting on the report .
Our group abstained from this vote . The reason for our abstention is not that we were in any way unappreciative of the work of Mr Oostlander and the Members who supported him .
Wherever he took a stance against the new manifestations of western European isolationism , which mainly lurk behind financial issues , he deserved and he had our support .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Welcome
I wish to announce that our Parliament is honoured to welcome in the official gallery a parliamentary delegation from the Ukrainian Parliament .
This delegation , which is led by Mr Andrei Mostytsky , will have working meetings today and tomorrow with our Parliament 's Delegation on Relations with the Ukraine .
I address our greetings to the Ukrainian delegation and wish it every success in its contacts and meetings with our Parliament .
Welcome to you .
Chernobyl , prospects for EU involvement
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to make it quite clear from the start .
Chernobyl must and shall be closed down .
It is a monumental affront to human civilization and totally unacceptable that the plant is still in operation .
This is my policy , and the Commission 's , and that is how it has been pursued in all fora .
It is now 10 years since the Chernobyl accident occurred .
The memory of this tragedy remains as clear as if it had happened yesterday .
It will , unfortunately , remain with us for many generations to come .
Chernobyl has become yet another symbol of the unthinkable on a par with very few other human catastrophes .
The shock was so great because this accident not only affected the immediate vicinity , but also areas thousands of kilometres from the scene .
It affected , and continues to affect , all of us directly .
Various organizations have analysed the effects on health , the environment and the economy .
Sometimes the findings of these investigations are fairly similar , while in other instances , assessments of the consequences of the disaster are quite different .
For example , the WHO , the Commission and other international organizations estimate the number of deaths definitely attributable to the direct effects of radiation at about 30 .
Other assessments put the number of deaths resulting from the accident far higher .
But let us not discuss the number of victims at this juncture .
Every individual person who dies , or suffers as a result of the accident , is one too many .
Ladies and gentlemen , our common position must be that such an accident must never happen again .
The conditions for world-wide cooperation have never been as good as at present .
In contrast with 1986 the world is no longer divided by the Cold War .
In place of earlier confrontation , we have now established a network of cooperation with the countries of the former Soviet Union .
I can illustrate this by means of two examples .
At the end of this week the G7 countries are to hold a summit on nuclear safety with President Yeltsin in Moscow , which President Kuchma will also attend .
Such a meeting , which is to deal exclusively with co-operation in these areas , would have been quite unthinkable 10 years ago .
The Commission is convinced that it will be able to contribute towards the promotion and spread of a highly developed safety culture at an international level .
The second example is the Commission 's satisfaction at President Kuchma 's decision to close down Chernobyl by the year 2000 .
First of all a brief word about the support .
As regards the health situation in general , the European Commission assists via its humanitarian office ECHO with medical resources and the monitoring of the rural population .
The Commission also supplies special equipment for the treatment of thyroid gland cancer in children in Kiev and Minsk , and is helping to rehabilitate a children 's hospital in Minsk .
Such measures meet a very specific need , and we should , of course , continue with them .
This applies to programmes such as those in PHARE and TACIS .
An important step forward - as I have already stressed - is the signing of the G7Ukraine memorandum on the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power station .
There are about 4 000 people working at the Chernobyl plant at present .
In addition , the plant provides income for the town of Slavuchid .
In addition to solving the problem of the actual Chernobyl plant , there is also the problem of dealing with the contaminated waste from the surrounding area .
Immediately after the accident in 1986 , the radioactive waste was collected and deposited at between 600-800 different sites , some temporary and some permanent .
In some of the places where waste has been deposited and stored , the ground water has been contaminated , and there is a need for isolating it or carrying out a clean-up operation .
The European Commission has also launched an investigation into the various options for the rehabilitation of the regions contaminated by the fallout from the accident .
What have we learnt from this accident ?
Then there was the question of reactor safety and the prevention of future accidents .
Reactors of the Chernobyl type , the so-called RBMK reactors , have never been constructed outside the Soviet Union .
In 1986 , the nuclear safety authorities and operators of nuclear power stations in the Community had learned from the Three Mile Island accident in the USA in 1979 .
The Chernobyl accident confirmed the importance of these aspects and emphasised further the need for a well prepared disaster plan outside the actual nuclear power station .
The competent authorities in the Member States take account of all these aspects when authorizing the operation of nuclear plants .
For its part , the European Commission supports the development of these aspects of nuclear safety through numerous groups of experts and study activities .
Together , these activities contribute towards the further strengthening of safety consciousness and the safety of all bodies involved in the safe operation of nuclear plants .
This safety culture results , in turn , in an ongoing improvement of the level of safety in existing and planned plants .
The Nuclear Safety Convention drawn up under the auspices of The International Atomic Energy Organisation in 1994 will make a contribution towards global nuclear safety .
It has been signed by more than 50 states , including the 15 Member States of the Union , and the former Soviet Union .
The aim of the convention is to promote a high level of safety in nuclear power plants , to prevent accidents and to minimize their repercussions .
The convention is expected to come into force in 1997 or , possibly , this year .
But there is still a great deal to be done .
The European Commission will , of course , analyse the most important conclusions drawn at the Vienna conference last week by eminent figures from throughout the world .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am sorry to have arrived a little late , but I would like to explain the reasons for that .
That is the reason I was late .
Commissioner Bjerregaard has very exhaustively set out everything that has been done by the Union , so there is no need for me to exceed my speaking time .
This is a brief illustration of the policy lines which the Council has proposed and which I think it has followed with great consistency .
I would like to conclude by observing that , in the end , the Chernobyl tragedy has introduced a new stage into the nuclear safety culture .
Commissioner , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , ten years of effort - little to show .
Secondly , the concrete casing of the entombed reactor is unsafe and unstable .
It urgently requires an additional shell , all the more so since the No 3 Reactor is right beside it .
Thirdly , the human misery goes on .
The environment is contaminated by caesium ; skin diseases , cancers and depopulation are the typical long-term effects .
To reiterate the point in plain terms , the nuclear risk has not lessened since 1986 but has remained exactly the same .
That is why we must all work together in order to take a step forward .
No-one can master this mammoth task alone - neither the Ukrainians , nor the EU , nor the industrialized nations .
We must operate hand in hand .
The European Union has already invested many million ECUs .
The Commissioner has kindly given us a very comprehensive account of this effort .
We shall do even more .
We want to provide more help .
It is not easy for Ukraine to decommission the Chernobyl plant .
Chernobyl covers six to seven per cent of national energy requirements .
Decommissioning costs a lot of money .
That is why those responsible need assistance .
But we also know that the Ukraine is one of the most energy-intensive countries in the world .
The Ukrainians consume most energy per head of population .
Additional means of meeting the demand for energy , such as combined gas and steam turbine plants , can also be discussed , of course .
There is a realistic prospect of supplying energy without Chernobyl , without power stations .
We shall not let ourselves be pressurized into immediate unbridled construction of new power stations , as was suggested in one of today 's newspapers .
The year 2000 is the agreed target date for abandonment , and that is the target for which we must all continue to aim .
Mr President , once again , we are discussing Chernobyl .
For ten years , there has been nothing but talk , talk , talk .
If we are simply going to come here and make vague statements , perhaps we should turn our attention to something else .
I do not forget that - as you both rightly said - we are talking about an independent and sovereign country .
And I should like to address the representatives of the people of Ukraine who are in the gallery this afternoon : I am sure that it is the Ukrainian people who have the greatest interest in shutting down Chernobyl .
And it is the Ukrainian Government too , since all governments respond to the demands of their people .
So why is it not shut down ?
Why do we simply talk and hold countless conferences , and it is not shut down ?
For purely economic reasons .
The European Union has not contributed USD 4000 million , which I believe is what Mr Lange said .
It has contributed scarcely ECU 300 million : a pittance .
And so we shall go on speaking in platitudes and making vague statements , like this afternoon , and we shall all continue to despair .
Everyone here , everyone in Europe , wishes all the Chernobyl reactors to be shut down - and as soon as possible .
However , we all wish the people of Ukraine to have the improved standard of living which they desperately need .
They are going through hard economic times , although things have improved a little recently .
They have vast energy needs .
It is true that they could save a large amount of energy : however , Mr Lange , if you have worked in this sector , you will know that saving energy requires large-scale investment .
Let us help them to make that investment .
Furthermore , Commissioner , I think that it would be a good thing if the Commission submitted to us a report containing some genuine data .
You said that some reports refer to 30 deaths .
Clearly , there have been many more .
Those were just the 30 direct deaths at the time the fire was extinguished .
Another report refers to hundred of thousands of deaths , hundred of thousands of cases of thyroid cancer .
And do not come back to us next year and repeat that safety is threatened , that democracy ...
no , no , no !
We want solutions .
And we want rapid solutions , because absolutely nothing has been done for the last ten years .
Provide all the money .
It will be worth it , for what we are doing now is far more costly .
Does the money exist ?
In theory , no : but you can find it if you want to .
You will have Parliament 's full support , and I am sure that you will also have the support of the 15 Member States .
Furthermore , we shall be investigating ways to collaborate in building a new sarcophagus , and shutting down and dismantling the entire Chernobyl plant - which may cost a further USD 2300 million .
Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office , this will be your data - the G7 's - at the meeting in Moscow at the end of the year .
In any event , you can count on Parliament 's full support for whatever you do : but please do something serious .
We do not want simply words .
Mr President , I am expressing the feeling of my group , and at the same time the generally shared feeling of the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy which I have the honour to chair .
Certainly an important step was taken with the memorandum of understanding signed at Ottawa by the G7 countries .
Clearly our intervention in the Ukraine must proceed with caution so as not to deprive that country of 6 % of the energy it needs .
Mr Lange has already mentioned the other power stations and in fact we are in a situation of extreme risk involving a whole series of other power stations in other eastern European countries .
That will be the aim of our committee .
But we shall not be doing any of this !
We are going to spend 18 months discussing the ' list cost planning ' for new nuclear power-stations .
After all , the French nuclear lobby , which has its representatives in the Commission , G7 and EURATOM , is going to try and defend its position in this Chamber .
The European Parliament must not be in cahoots with this measure and Parliament must ask for what Mrs Estevan and Mr Langer called for !
First question : how often will it be necessary to keep adding new layers to the Chernobyl sarcophagus ?
How much does that cost , and how many times is it foreseen that this will have to be done in the future ?
Every ten years , and for how many centuries will that have to happen in the future ?
What is the estimated cost of each new layer on the sarcophagus and what are the risks involved ?
Second question : which are the other nuclear stations that represent imminent hazards ?
You spoke about those in the former Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe .
Yet you too , Mr President-in-Office , are pressing for the completion of the Khmelnisky II and Rovno stations to be financed with one-billion ECU .
Why ?
On what reasoning , if there is more generally any reasoning behind your action ?
Which other stations are dangerous in the long term ?
Have you anything to tell us about the Kosloduy station in Bulgaria , where accidents have already happened ?
Perhaps you are waiting for a more serious accident to take place before turning your attention towards it ?
Are there any prospects of an agreement with Bulgaria for Kosloduy to close , or are we going to wait for victims there too and only then turn up to treat the cancers ?
Finally : are the most modern technologies in the rest of Europe free from risk ?
Do they not cost ?
Because otherwise , I think we are debating here without any essential meaning .
Mr President , many roads lead to the MCA - the maximum credible accident .
For all our dealings with accidents and disaster , is it perhaps the case that , despite the misery they have caused , we have yet to learn our lesson from them ?
Thousands , indeed hundreds of thousands , of children are ill or have been born handicapped , and the rate is increasing .
Although areas of land the size of the Netherlands are contaminated , we have allowed time to elapse without taking action .
The RBMK and VVER reactors are scrap heaps and will remain so , and retrofits will do nothing to alter that !
They have no emergency cooling systems and no fire-prevention mechanisms , and it is of very little use , for instance , when the operators say that they have good firefighting teams .
There is a lack of instruction manuals .
Safety precautions on site are absolutely minimal .
The sum of ECU 550 million has already been pumped in from the PHARE and TACIS programmes .
What do we have to show for it ?
First of all , 90 % of the funds have been disbursed in western Europe on safety studies .
Strictly speaking , the object of the exercise has been to open the door to new markets .
We have not achieved any more security at these sites .
There can surely be no question of that .
What has occurred is not a reduction but rather a prolongation of the risk .
That has to be acknowledged once and for all .
We are categorically opposed to the completion of two reactors which are already in an absolutely desolate condition and cannot be properly completed .
For six billion dollars we could have new cogeneration plants , generating both heat and power , with an output of 10 000 megawatts .
Instead of that , money is being squandered so that some companies can earn more profits .
It is scandalous , unacceptable and a disgrace to the European Union .
Let me say one more thing .
In western Europe we have many reactors that are no better than those .
If we continue to pursue the same policies here , the next MCA will come along as swiftly and surely as night follows day !
Mr President , I welcome the representatives from Ukraine to whom all our hearts go out .
Could I ask everyone a question who may be listening to this : will the next nuclear disaster following Chernobyl be in Chernobyl ?
That is a chilling but a real question .
Poor Ukraine - 29 % of their budget spent on clean-up .
Yet as my colleague here said , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is going to spend our money on two other reactors as a price for the agreement of closure .
We must decide that the time for talking has really ended and really put our hands in our pockets and give the money that is necessary to clean up this situation .
We know that Ukraine is heavily dependent on this type of energy , so we have to face up to this .
We know the cost of nuclear decommissioning and we should take a hard look at nuclear energy .
I happen to belong to an anti-nuclear party , I am President of it in Scotland .
I sit with colleagues who are pro-nuclear because France has a different attitude to that .
I can understand that .
Sweden was the most heavily nuclear-dependent country , and yet they have taken a different attitude .
Perhaps we have to look at the whole question of our energy policy .
If we do not know how to destroy the monster we create , have we any right to create any more monsters ?
That is really the question .
Sitting up there are brave people who have come to see us today and I hope I have the chance to meet them .
We have to pledge our solidarity , not just with words , but with finance .
Mr President , Chernobyl has gone down in history as the biggest nuclear disaster of all times .
The disaster is imprinted on the minds of many residents of Ukraine .
And not just there .
The consequences are imprinted on the bodies of people and on their descendants .
It happened only ten years ago .
How many tens of thousands of people are still facing day in day out the gruesome consequences of over-radiation ?
We do not even have accurate numbers .
That is why it is right that the international community should continue to remember them .
A tenth anniversary such as this serves the purpose of focusing public attention .
Have we really no idea ?
Closure is the only answer .
I fervently hope that the Ukrainian government will give its cooperation .
If the rich countries come up with sufficient money then nothing will stand in their way .
But we have not reached that stage yet .
Has the time not come to decide to close down the remaining fifteen power stations of the Chernobyl type ?
Everyone knows that this will be extremely costly , both for the dismantling of the installations and for the provision of alternative energy supplies .
But the international community must recognise that this is a problem that is far too great for an individual country or group of countries to tackle alone .
In financial terms the former Soviet Union is not up to it .
It would be a demonstration of international solidarity if not only the G7 but all affluent countries were to agree on a plan to make these dangerous power stations disappear from the face of the earth .
The collapse of the Iron Curtain has created a number of new responsibilities for the countries of the West .
Now that we can afford to spend gradually less on defence the money saved should at least be used to improve the situation in the former East bloc .
And that includes closing down these power stations .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it was the Chernobyl disaster which made public opinion aware of the dangers of nuclear technology .
But that was ten years ago .
At the time , the Greens certainly expressed concern at these problems , but being bound by political friendships and dependence , they were silent on the subject of the building of nuclear power stations in the East .
The National Front , for its part , has been making its views on this subject clear since 1978 .
It has always been cautious as regards the whole dogma of nuclear technology .
Moreover , this was the subject of one of our first pamphlets .
In 1980 , we campaigned in favour of civil protection , insisting on the need to build nuclear shelters .
And , in 1986 , the disaster which we had been fearing for nearly ten years occurred .
At the same time , he called for the implementation of a responsible and effective security policy for times of both peace and conflict .
By way of example , only seven radioactive fallout warning systems had been commissioned at that time .
Naturally , none of them was yet in operation .
As for the budget allocated to civil safety in the nuclear sector , it was simply ridiculous .
It was unbelievable !
We have consistently warned in advance of the disasters that have occurred in these closing decades of the twentieth century .
Nuclear energy seemed to be a taboo subject .
Furthermore , information was withheld , on the pretext of not causing panic .
This is arbitrary and dangerous behaviour which gives cause for concern .
The majority of the élite were wrong .
Insanity prevailed over reason . Our leaders were blinded by the dogma - condemned by certain colleagues - of progress , mass consumerism and free trade .
Why should we be surprised if cows go mad when , sadly , they have been turned into carnivorous cannibals ?
Why should we question nuclear technology ?
Clearly , nuclear disasters would have ceased long ago if moderation had prevailed over the excitement of all the sorcerer 's apprentices .
Ultimately , it is the choice of our form of society which is at fault .
Today , the tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster leads us to debate this issue - but it is no longer simply a question of Chernobyl .
There are dozens of Chernobyls .
We should like to know , moreover , as my colleague said earlier , more or less where things stand .
It gripped us deeply .
However , it has diminished ; it has gradually ebbed away .
Whilst some actions have been taken , they have proved to be insufficient .
More clearly needs to be done .
The sarcophagus of the Chernobyl 4 nuclear reactor could be much better and more effective .
The original clean-up from the original disaster could have been done much better and more effectively .
Indeed , as regards the effects upon human health that have occurred in terms of cancer and other sicknesses , much more could and should have been done .
Most of all , what should have been done is that we should have stopped the possibility of such a disaster again .
That sadly , is our biggest problem .
That sadly , is our biggest unachieved task .
Many reactors of exactly the same kind as Chernobyl - in some cases in worse condition than Chernobyl - still exist and are in operation in Russia and other parts of the CIS .
I am sure the Commission would agree that this alternative approach to solving the power needs of East and Central Europe , as opposed to a nuclear programme , is the one that we should pursue .
On this tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster we must rekindle our fears and our concerns to ensure that we have the determination to take the action necessary to stop this ever happening again .
We must take hold of the initial agreement in the form of the memorandum of understanding and develop it further at the G7 .
We must close dangerous reactors - not just Chernobyl , but elsewhere also - and we must resolve ways in which to find the funding to do so .
We must provide that funding no matter how much it costs .
Mr President , 10 years have now passed since the Chernobyl nuclear power station disaster .
This accident brought to light that there are numerous power stations in the former Soviet Union built with the same technology and with a highly unreliable safety record .
Some of these are very close to Finland , in Karelia and other neighbouring areas .
In Finland we currently have four nuclear power stations which have worked impeccably and meet Western European safety criteria .
The Finnish energy supply authorities consider that we need to build a fifth nuclear power station .
There is thus no chance of building new nuclear power stations until people are certain that they are safe .
At the same time we must endeavour to close down these dangerous power stations as soon as possible .
As I have said , there is a great deal of opposition in Finland at present to nuclear power , which in practice prevents any further nuclear power stations from being built .
Consequently , attention has turned to natural gas .
In my opinion this Northern Gas Network should be added to the EU 's Europe-wide gas networks .
The matter is being discussed today at the Visby conference .
Marjatta SteniusKaukonen has tabled an amendment to the opinion on the abovementioned gas network .
I would ask you , Members of the European Parliament present here , to support this amendment by Mrs Stenius-Kaukonen which all members of the Finnish parliament across party boundaries support .
When natural gas networks and safety are increased throughout Europe , this will tend to reduce fear of nuclear power stations as well .
Mr President , Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz , Mrs Ewing and Mr Pimenta have said it all today .
This is hard to credit .
In November last year at the Chernobyl second reactor three workmen were exposed to massive doses of radiation and we still have not learned the lesson .
It is vital that the European Union plays a central and constructive role in ensuring the practical provision of resources under programmes such as TACIS .
This programme is aimed at supporting nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union .
Given the condition of many nuclear power plants there one cannot underestimate the importance of the programme .
However , this programme cannot work unless the European Union makes sure that sufficient resources and grants are available for TACIS to carry out its task .
Finally , as has been said by Mrs Ewing , Chernobyl is not a unique plant .
They exist all over Europe .
Where will the next nuclear disaster be ?
As an Irish Member I must refer to the Sellafield plant in the UK .
For many years the Irish people have lived under a cloud of unease as the Sellafield plant has stumbled from one safety misdemeanour to another .
We have had enough of this .
Nuclear accidents do not respect borders and no Member State can act on its own .
Mr President , Chernobyl was the accident that could not happen .
It is quite insane to imagine pollution on that scale .
Just think , they really said that back in the 1970 ' s .
The technology could not go wrong .
That is why some people had some problems explaining themselves 10 years ago .
The answer was , of course , that it was because the Soviet Union was undemocratic .
It is not that simple .
With all technology of that type there is probably a danger - albeit slight - of an accident . But if the accident does occur , then the risk is great .
There is only one answer to Chernobyl : it must be closed down .
It is the only answer decent people can give to using technology which was anything but harmless .
The truth is , of course , that we in the West also bear a responsibility for promoting this technology .
That is not the answer .
Energy savings and the use of other forms of energy is the answer .
Mr President , ten years ago over two million children were exposed to the fall-out from Chernobyl .
It was an accident that appalled the world and released 300 times more radioactivity than fell on Hiroshima .
Until now there has been a conspiracy to deny that any damage to the health of those people and children is a result of radiation .
The International Atomic Energy Agency nuclear safety division has been at the forefront of this cover-up .
This was in spite of mounting evidence of thyroid cancers in children at the time .
Because those children were not screened and not treated , some of them died , and the IAEA is responsible for those deaths .
In 1995 over 400 cases of thyroid cancers were documented in children .
The WHO radiation expert has gone on record about the opposition to this project encountered at all stages of its development .
I say to you today that one slow , lingering death of one child from radiation is one too many !
The IAEA at their conference in Vienna last week still deny these findings , although the Ukrainian , Russian and Belarussian delegations dispute their figures .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Another subject touched on by the Commissioner was that of the culture of nuclear safety .
An accident at a nuclear power station , in the East or the West , is simply a question of a greater or lesser probability .
Please , do not finance the construction of any new nuclear reactors in the former Soviet Union !
I know what I am talking about , because I come from a region which is threatened by the Cattenom reactors built by EDF .
Mr President , ten years on from the explosion in the fourth reactor of the Chernobyl power station the emergency continues , above all in Belarus and the Ukraine .
In 1995 , according to the Belarussian health ministry , 400 out of 500 babies with pathologies had cancer .
The incidence of cancer in the infant population is 50 times higher than 10 years ago .
Official sources put deaths in the Ukraine at 180 , 000 and birth rate , death rate and cancer statistics are similar to those described earlier .
Mr President , I should like to begin by expressing my disappointment to the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council .
The other RBMK reactors , a total of 15 , are still on line , after all .
We know a lot about the sarcophagus , but we are far from knowing how to deal with it .
The only thing we know about the whole business is that we actually know nothing .
Proposals - for which we have paid dearly , I might add - unfortunately abound .
There are also risks in the irradiated areas of the Urals or in the former nuclear weapons test site in what is now the Republic of Kazakhstan , etc .
It is true that we have provided money ; I make it a total of some 600 million dollars given by the West to the former Soviet republics .
However , it is estimated that we should need around 15 to 20 billion dollars to do everything the experts have proposed .
It is a package - and let me say this to my honourable colleagues too - it is a package that includes the completion of two VVER reactors .
Anyone seeking to drop this condition is putting a match to the entire package .
We have to be quite clear about that .
( Heckling by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz ) No , no , we must be aware that the removal of this condition means dismantling and destroying the whole thing .
That is just how it is .
That would be extremely regrettable .
In Russia , Ukraine and Lithuania , there are still 15 reactors of the same design as Chernobyl in operation .
The long-term effects of the disaster on man and the environment have still not been researched .
There are still the most enormous difficulties involved in providing proper medical care for the victims .
That is why I am highly sceptical about the special meeting of the G7 in Moscow on 19 and 20 April devoted exclusively to nuclear safety .
There is a conclusive and authoritative study which demonstrates that upgrading the Mochovce reactor to western safety standards is not only shortsighted but downright impossible .
Ten years after Chernobyl the danger is ever-present , and despite the thousands of deaths the station continues to operate .
On the 19th and 20th of this month in Moscow , at a new meeting between the Seven and the Ukraine , as has already been said , the question of finance is to be discussed .
However , money alone cannot solve the problem , other things are needed as well , most of all a change in our thinking .
Because Chernobyl is not the only place with problems .
In Bulgaria , very close to us , the Kosloduy station is considered the next most dangerous after Chernobyl since last October when it resumed operation .
Despite all the pressures by the European Union the date for its operation to cease is constantly being postponed .
The nuclear station of Metzamor in Armenia is also regarded as problematic and others too have been mentioned here , while many more still are likely to emerge in the future .
Mr President , have we not learned anything in the last ten years ?
Scientific evidence shows that 60 000 deaths were directly caused by the after-effects of the Chernobyl accident and not 30 .
Perhaps they were the ones who died immediately .
Innumerable people became ill .
Six hundred thousand people had to be evacuated .
The EBRD now wants to make one billion dollars available for the completion of two reactors in Ukraine .
That is the price for the closure of Chernobyl .
How long shall we continue to support this extremely hazardous technology with its frighteningly inadequate safeguards ?
Two days ago we learned that Mochovce is to be built with Russian and Czech money .
I just marvel at all the things for which Russia has money .
French and German companies such as Siemens will help to build this dangerous nuclear centre .
That is scandalous !
In Germany the same sort of reactor did not receive an operating licence .
It is truly scandalous ! Mochovce is a nightmare !
It endangers the whole of central Europe .
Vienna is almost within sight of it . How many million deaths does the EU need before it will agree to change its energy policy ?
We need different solutions in Ukraine , and we need different solutions throughout central Europe .
I do not want membership of the EU to be conferred on any country that jeopardizes the health and safety of the people of another country .
I now ask the Council whether its policy on Slovakia is changing as regards the talks on Union membership .
Mr President , on 20 December 1995 , a memorandum of understanding was signed in Ottawa by the representatives of the G7 , the European Commission and Ukraine .
This memorandum of understanding contains something good : the decision to shut down Chernobyl by the year 2000 .
It also contains something very bad , however : the decision to complete work on the two nuclear power stations at Khmelnisky and Rovno .
Chernobyl and its aftermath are not only a problem for Ukraine and the other affected regions in Russia and Belarus , but a problem for Europe in its entirety .
Even though the accident had largely disappeared from the media headlines prior to this anniversary , it has nevertheless caused a profound change of outlook among the people of Europe .
A similar situation prevails at the Slovenian nuclear plant in Krsko . There are also serious safety defects there , which could have especially dire consequences since Krsko is built on a fault line into the bargain .
These problems cannot and must not be omitted from the accession negotiations between these states and the EU .
It is about our present and our future .
It is the symbol of a danger with which we are confronted anew every day .
Nuclear safety is indispensable , not only to the countries of central and eastern Europe but also to all the countries of the Union and the whole of Europe .
Madam President , I was here in Parliament when the Chernobyl explosion took place .
Perhaps it was the appalling vista of the potential effects of that explosion that caused so many governments and individuals to run for cover ; because they simply could not contemplate it .
The full impact of the radioactive fall-out on human health is still being assessed , and I do not believe adequately assessed .
Already we have seen a generation of children with grotesque and life-threatening malformations .
We have done too little to alleviate the pain and distress of these children and their families .
Many generous families and medical specialists in my own country are doing splendid work , but the scale of the disaster requires a concentrated and coordinated world-wide response .
We must provide more medical help for these victims .
I fear that the potential consequences , should the downside of the nuclear industry become more widely evident , are probably too much for some of our Member States to bear .
Madam President , Madam Commissioner , ten years on from the disaster at Chernobyl we are beginning to understand its breadth and gravity .
We know the technical reasons for it today , we know that the RMVK reactor had an intrinsic design defect .
Certain problems of a strictly nuclear nature remain open , and the fuel still in the reactor , the sites where highly radio-active waste is buried , and the actual sarcophagus , do not instil confidence .
All these problems are our concern , naturally they are the concern of the Ukraine first and foremost , but they are also our concern .
Unsafe power stations must be closed , wherever they are , and a sensible energy policy encouraged , particularly in the eastern European countries .
That is the thrust of the joint resolution we have presented with other parliamentary colleagues and which we naturally support .
And this is done despite the fact that 200 reputable scientists from Belarus , the Russian Federation and Ukraine have already identified an increase in cancer , leukaemia and organic brain damage .
For Belarus , the hardest-hit country , the equivalent of 31 annual budgets would be needed to establish some degree of control over the impact on man and nature .
That country cannot possibly afford to take such action .
That is why Belarus is pursuing a policy of rehabilitation , has cut social welfare and has legalized resettlement , and the whole thing is supported by TACIS aid , which is promoting economic development in highly irradiated areas .
At present - and this is the Council and the Commission 's message , one which is perhaps a little disappointing , but nonetheless real - we have the G7 's memorandum of understanding .
That is the basis of our approach .
Clearly , we do not have the resources , at European Union level , to conduct a large-scale action programme in this field .
We need an international agreement .
We have one .
Perhaps some people do not like some aspects of that agreement .
Perhaps other solutions , other types of action , could have been envisaged , but we all know how difficult international negotiations are .
We have this agreement , this memorandum , and we must stick to it .
Beyond that , is there room for the European Union to carry out more specific measures with its more modest resources ?
I believe that we could take action , for example - as Mrs Banotti mentioned - in the field of medical assistance .
This is a field in which the European Union could conduct an action programme .
In this area , Commissioner , perhaps you could submit to us a more specific proposal for discussion at a meeting in the near future , which I hope will be more constructive .
I agree with Mr Desama that the memorandum of understanding is a positive initiative , which Parliament must in no way try to play down .
Consequently , there is a need for a substantial increase in both investment and the political will to take the necessary measures in the area of nuclear safety .
It is time to call for the opening of a new phase of nuclear safety , as regards both control of the dangers and treatment of the waste from nuclear power stations .
Commissioner , I would urge you to respond to the pressure from Parliament by bringing forward the economic proposals that it is calling for this afternoon , with a view to tackling the problem firmly .
Madam President , all the motions for resolutions call for the closure of Chernobyl-type reactors .
That is what has prompted me to speak today .
As chairman of the Delegation for Relations with Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , I have visited the Ignalina plant on several occasions .
Today , I would like to describe the situation in Lithuania with regard to this plant .
It is Europe 's largest power plant .
The carbon rods which control the cooling system have a remaining lifespan of possibly 8 years .
They are silting up .
There are problems with the spent fuel rods .
There are no plans for how they are to be regenerated or stored .
The government in Lithuania cannot come to a decision , because it is good economic business to operate this plant .
The plant management even talk about continuing , about expanding , about creating a Unit 3 .
There is therefore a discrepancy between the policy agreed with Lithuania on this plant , and the plant 's management .
Perhaps that is where the problem lies .
It also requires a great deal of money .
I welcome the G7 memorandum , but in my view this should be a subject for more in-depth consideration by the Intergovernmental Conference .
There have been quite a lot of different figures put forward regarding the nature of the accident and the number of victims .
It is often the way that there are different measurements of this kind of thing .
I have based my information on WHO data , but it is not so much the numbers which should concern us , but rather the will to help the victims which we know there have been .
I personally regard that as a very important effort over the 10 years .
Also the last comments from Mr Sindal regarding the situation in Lithuania were instructive .
I do not , therefore , think that we have merely been talking .
I think that there has been international co-operation .
I believe , also , that considerable efforts have been made .
Both for Ukraine and the people of Ukraine , of course , not enough effort has been made , and until then there is a major task ahead of us .
Thank you for the debate .
So it cannot be said that nothing has been done .
Certainly we must do far more , that seems obvious : we must do far more now and we will have to do far more in the future .
Let me say quite frankly that far more needs to be done in many respects , but I do not think it is possible to do everything for everyone in every case .
So it cannot be said that the States are doing nothing and it certainly cannot be said that the European Union is doing nothing .
I would also like to make some detailed comments . A lot has been said about the Ukraine , and we naturally extend our solidarity to the Ukrainian delegation here today .
But we also need to talk about Belarus , which is suffering equally serious pollution and human and social damage .
I also want to say that Mrs Stirbois is right - she is not in the Chamber at the moment - that there are also power stations in the west which may present risks .
I hope it will be approved as a further demonstration that Parliament is also determined to help on the Chernobyl issue .
I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Situation in the Middle East
The next item is the statement by the Council on the situation in the Middle East .
The issue we now have to deal with is a very delicate , very complex and very difficult one .
The Union has done everything possible and has spared no effort to try to reach , or at least facilitate , a solution to the troubles in the Middle East .
I think the European Union , strengthened by this record , has been in a position to express its concern about what is happening in Lebanon today .
The recommendation and the hope , all too obvious , is that violence will not breed violence , that chain reactions will not be triggered off and endanger the peace process .
The Member States of the Union regard the peace process as important because of the concrete results already achieved , and everyone is determined to do everything possible to prevent those achievements being compromised .
All the countries involved are being asked to contribute , as far as possible , to a reduction in the level of tension and above all - I repeat - to abstain from the use of force .
I think this action is strengthened by what has been done over the last few years .
The Italian presidency is maintaining that policy , especially by coordinating its own action with the countries of the area on the one hand , and with the United States and with Egypt on the other .
There is an American delegation in Rome at this very moment for that purpose .
It hardly needs sating that the attention of the Council and of all the Member States represented by the Council is concentrated on this issue .
Next Monday 's General Affairs Council in Luxembourg will definitely go further into the situation in the light of any information it has been possible to obtain .
The problem is close to all our hearts and has dramatically worsened in the last few days and hours .
Madam President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his report and we were particularly pleased to hear that the Troika are at this moment active in the region .
It is important that the European Council is seen to act through the Troika rather than just leaving actions to individual Member States of the Union , no matter how worthy and welcome those individual actions may be .
It is the action of the European Union that my group believes is crucial at this moment .
Those of us who have vested much hope and expectation in the Middle East process are today sad and despairing .
On behalf of the Socialist Group today we extend our undiluted support for that peace process .
We offer our support as well to the Israeli Labour Government and those of their Arab neighbours who have met the challenge of peace and have become bigger men because of it .
What were they supposed to do in the face of unprecedented murders , terrorism and sustained attack ?
It is always more difficult to tell your friends and those you respect that you believe they are wrong .
Rather it perpetuates hate , encourages yet more young Arabs to take up arms against Israel and it destabilizes Israel 's friendly Arab neighbours .
We condemn utterly those in Lebanon who have permitted the attacks against Israel to continue from Lebanese territory .
The European Union has a growing responsibility to support those seeking peace on its borders .
We owe it to Israel and to the Palestinians .
We owe it to the memory of Yitzhak Rabin and we owe it as well to Shimon Peres and to Yasser Arafat .
Of course we want Israel to stop the bombing that is causing such human misery to the civilian population in Lebanon .
But we also demand solidarity and real political commitment to support Israeli civilians against the terror of the extremists .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the situation in the Middle East is now extremely grave and there is a long list of victims on all sides .
In the face of this reality , sad as it is for the prospect of peace , I wish the European Union had done much more than it already has .
The immediate measures have four ingredients : on the one hand , an end to terrorist acts against Israel and provision of the security guarantees which that demands .
On the other hand , immediate cessation of bombardments by Israel and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the security zone in South Lebanon .
Long-term policy amounts in essence to just one thing - the continuation and support of the peace process already started .
In that sector we do in fact see substantial intervention and help , at least from the Commission .
Yet , still more initiatives are needed and must be undertaken by the Union .
I have already spoken about putting forward a range of trust-building measures to guarantee the continuation and support of the peace process .
No doubt there are other specific activities that could take place to make the most of such channels as the Union has already opened , but also - and why not - to open fresh ones as well .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , a motion has been tabled which expresses the anxiety of all the political groups in this House .
On behalf of the European People 's Party , I call for a vote in favour of that motion .
The first has already paid for his courageous commitment to peace with his life , and the position of the second is now being weakened by the new situation in the region .
We must reaffirm unequivocally the right of the Israeli people to live in peace and security within their internationally recognized and guaranteed borders .
We must call on all the warring parties to show the spirit of conciliation that is needed for the continuation of the peace process .
It is hard to accept without comment the statement by the Israeli Prime Minister that it is too early to negotiate .
It is never too early to negotiate to stop a war : to say otherwise would be to admit that a war can be justified and to exclude any kind of preventive diplomacy .
No one doubts the ability of the Israeli army to destroy Hizbollah - but at the cost of how many ' martyrs ' whose successors will demand vengeance ?
Furthermore , there is nothing to say that this is the Israeli Government 's objective - for is it not Syria , through poor Lebanon , which is its target ?
Is it therefore reasonable to call on the head of the Lebanese Government to disarm Hizbollah , whilst continuing to occupy part of that country 's territory ?
Evacuation and disarmament must go hand in hand .
Today , it is the rebuilding of Lebanon which is being called into question .
How many years will it take to erase from the collective mind of the peoples of the region the painful memories of the present conflict and those which have preceded it ?
The solution to the conflict will not be military , but diplomatic .
Similarly , we are entitled to call on our American partner , the United States Government - whose opinion , we know , counts for a great deal with the Israeli Government - to play a mediating role .
We welcome the ceasefire plan proposed by the United States Government , but the ceasefire must be implemented without delay .
In particular , the Israeli air force 's bombing raids on civilian targets in Lebanon must end immediately , because as the French Prime Minister said yesterday , they are unacceptable .
Naturally , the same goes for Hizbollah 's rocket attacks on northern Israel .
We can only deplore the large numbers of civilian victims of the conflict and the misery of the displaced populations .
Diplomacy must now prevail over bombs and rockets .
We must pray that the peace process will be resumed and continued .
We all hoped that the murder of Yitzhak Rabin would not be in vain , but would serve the cause of peace and not that of war , as his assassins wished .
Madam President , Israel 's current actions in South Lebanon do not constitute an attack , but a response to an attack .
This is the conviction which determines the Liberal Group 's position , and which underlies its motion for a resolution and the fact that it does not subscribe to the joint motion for a resolution .
In the present century , democracies have not waged war with one another .
Wars have always broken out between democracies and totalitarian or fanatical states , and that is what we are witnessing today .
It is for this reason that , whilst deploring the human tragedy currently being played out in the Middle East , we retain the hope that the peace process will not only be resumed , but extended .
In particular , we hope that a peace treaty between Israel and Lebanon - the Lebanon that we love - can also be signed .
Madam President , the Israeli bombing of Lebanon provokes our condemnation and concern .
It is plunging the defenceless Lebanese people into all the horrors of war - dead and wounded civilians , the destruction of property , and mass exodus .
And it is jeopardizing the entire peace process in the region , which gave rise to such hope .
Clearly , we can only condemn Hizbollah 's blind attacks on the Israeli population .
Far from contributing to its security , however , Israel 's bombing can only fan the flames of fundamentalism and encourage terrorism and its monstrous outrages .
In this region , as elsewhere , the escalation of violence is a dead end. Such a chain of events exposes the civilian population , which has such need of peace , to all the dangers of war .
Everything possible must be done to save the peace process and build a lasting peace in the region .
The European Union and each of its Member States must act to bring an end to Israel 's military actions and bombing in Lebanon .
It must bring its full weight to bear to help the resumption of the peace process and the building of a lasting peace which guarantees the security of all the peoples of the region .
We believe that the peace process is now at risk - it must be continued .
We are happy to agree with the liberals that the peace process must be expanded to include Lebanon and Syria .
We demand that Israel stop the bombing immediately and enter into negotiations .
The Israelis must also show clearly that they are prepared to withdraw from Lebanon completely as part of an agreed peaceful settlement of the conflict .
Syria must use its influence to put an end to the Hizbollah action .
We condemn the attitude of the Iranian government and we urge the Commission to draw up a comprehensive plan for humanitarian aid for those who have suffered in the Israeli attacks .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , the events of the last few days in Lebanon fill us with dismay , since they are threatening the peace process which we have welcomed from the start .
Certainly , we can and must understand the reaction of the Israeli Government , which cannot stand back and watch while terrorist attacks increase and its citizens are killed .
We can also understand the difficulties of Prime Minister Peres , who is facing elections and is obliged to demonstrate his firmness .
And we can express our concern that Israel 's response is a disproportionate one , all the more so in that it is impossible to see how the crisis can be resolved by force .
As for the international diplomatic initiatives , they are hardly likely to reassure us .
Firstly , I would comment on the almost total absence of the European Union , which once again has been overtaken by events .
Furthermore , Israel will only talk to the United States , and seems to think that it is the only possible mediator .
The United States ' peace plan has finally been examined by the opposing governments .
France , for its part , has attempted a number of measures , but without consulting the other Member States beforehand - which is hardly in keeping with the European spirit .
Neither Israel nor the United States make this mistaken assumption .
In the face of this mess , however , let us hope that the meeting next Friday between Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat will enable the region to emerge from this nightmare .
Madam President , after the suicide attacks by the Hamas the rocket assaults on Northern Israel by the Shiite Hizbollah movement show clearly how fragile the peace process is in the Middle East .
The freedom that Syria and in its wake Lebanon are giving to the actions of the Hizbollah is a major obstacle to reaching a definitive peace settlement .
It is unacceptable that this movement is allowed to wage such acts of aggression from Lebanese soil .
One basic principle of international law is that no country may make its territory available for enemy activities against another country .
As diplomatic means had no chance of success they had no option other than this to defend themselves .
They have sufficient means if only they have the political determination to do so .
I would therefore urge both the Council and the Commission to stress action against the Hizbollah in their contacts with both countries .
The independence of the Lebanese state must also be re-established by Syria and Iran ending their interference in Lebanon .
Finally developments in Lebanon form an additional reason to exert diplomatic pressure on Iran .
Iran is an important source of support and inspiration for the Hizbollah movement .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , once again , Lebanon is being battered and bruised in a war which the two rival powers in the region are waging on its territory .
Syria arms the Hizbollah militias in their war - which it firmly controls - against Israel .
Hizbollah was created by and for Syria .
Given that the Israelis know and declare that the Syrian authorities are behind Hizbollah , therefore , why do they not hit Damascus - for that is where the movement 's leaders live ?
Its arms dumps , barracks and training camps are all in Syria .
The truth is plain to see .
Israel and Syria have a cynical , immoral and dishonourable pact to keep the war in Lebanon , and the latest incidents are just an episode in this situation .
It is to Syria 's advantage .
The war legitimizes its police and military regime and its occupation of Lebanon .
And it is to Israel 's advantage .
An economically prosperous Lebanon would mean the return of Beirut as a strong financial centre , at the expense of Haifa and Tel Aviv .
So Israel 's army destroys the power stations and the painstakingly rebuilt infrastructure in Christian territory in Lebanon .
Consequently , this pact suits both the Israeli Government - which is backed unconditionally by the United States - and , since the Gulf War , Syria 's dictators .
Meanwhile , no one cares if little children in Iraq and Lebanon are dying .
For them , there are no human rights !
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should not like to miss this opportunity to thank the presidency for their kind and helpful comments .
It was particularly valuable to learn that the Union had sent observers to the elections in Palestine .
From time to time you tell us , Mr President-in-Office , what the troika has been doing and what has been happening with the American delegation in Rome .
Now , in the light of your comments , I can better understand why the French Government chose to go it alone .
I wish to begin with the common ground that has characterized the Middle East policy of the European Parliament for many years .
First of all , the European Parliament has unequivocally and emphatically condemned every act of terrorism , including today 's Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel by the Hizbollah .
Secondly , irrespective of party and national allegiance , we in the European Parliament have welcomed and supported the peace process between Israel and the PLO .
Today I know that only the peace process , not military action , can achieve this . '
Mr Rabin , as a former hawk , was more able than anyone to convince people that there is only one way to solve the Israel-Palestine problem .
His conviction and his commitment to peace cost him his life .
Deaths , misery , expulsion and suffering are on our agenda today .
That is why this Parliament , which has spoken such clear words in the past , must turn to Israel today and tell it to stop the bombing and the expulsions in Lebanon right now !
We were pleased and delighted when the peace process started and the agreement was reached .
Today I have heard talk from many people on the floor of this House about war .
I hope it is not war .
I hope it is an act of terrorism that we are seeing and that we can actually get back to the peace process and the continuation of the agreement .
Terrorism stops the peace process and I believe that some people have a lot to answer for at the present time , namely Hamas and Hizbollah .
Of course Syria is involved , and , of course , Syria must be a key player in the eventual solution .
We as a Community must act together and I am delighted to hear the President-inOffice say that the Troika is currently looking at the situation .
I hope that just looking at the situation actually produces some results , because we must get a solution !
We cannot , as a Community , keep depending on the United States to solve all the problems in the world , and that is what it currently looks like .
We must get up a little bit earlier , as President Clinton has advised us .
But we must also understand the Israeli response to the current situation .
I am convinced , having been to Israel a couple of times recently , that they seek and desire peace .
In the negotiations and in the agreement they have already given up a lot .
They have given much towards the peace process and yet we are not seeing the peace process being delivered from the other side .
I do not myself feel inclined , therefore , to condemn outright the Israeli response to what is happening at the present time .
When they were under attack , when their citizens were being killed , it was not easy for them .
We must look at the whole situation .
There is one government in the Middle East which is guilty of crimes within its own country as well as within the Middle East generally and that , of course , is Iran .
We need concerted action from the Community , we need coordinated action , and I hope that the Troika can deliver it .
Mr President , this Parliament has expressed on numerous occasions its unequivocal support for the Middle East peace process initiated by the Oslo Agreements .
With equal firmness , it has condemned the terrorist attacks which directly threaten that process by sustaining a familiar strategy of raising tension .
It has also said , though , that combating terrorism effectively means bringing an end to the conditions which provide its breedingground .
Rather , they will be eliminated by strictly complying with the commitments made to the Palestinian National Authority .
Moreover , those attacks are causing numerous civilian casualties , including children .
And , above all , they are seriously undermining the stability which the region desperately needs , as well as the peace process as a whole .
If Israel complies with those international resolutions , Hizbollah and its sponsors will be isolated and deprived of all justification for their actions .
Association agreements , Mr President , must be made conditional on compliance with international resolutions and the non-use of military means to resolve problems .
And no one can remain indifferent to the suffering of civilian populations , in Lebanon or elsewhere .
The terrorist movements responsible for these actions , these murders , have been clearly identified .
They have the backing and financial support of a terrorist state - Iran - and operate from Lebanon , a country which is largely under the military control of Syria .
The European Parliament must take action along these lines , thereby assisting the peace process and its architects on the ground .
It must unequivocally demand the ending of all negotiations and all contact with Iran , until that country condemns terrorism .
Peace in the Middle East depends on this far more than on resolutions .
In this respect , in our words and deeds , we must all be resolute , determined and specific .
Mr President , once again , the Middle East has been the scene of tragic events .
Should we really be surprised ?
The considerable progress on the road to peace made over the last few years led us to believe that the conditions for a stable and lasting solution had finally been met .
In reality , fundamental problems , providing the implacable enemies of peace with forceful arguments , still remain .
Israel 's occupation of South Lebanon and the inability of the Lebanese Government to guarantee the region 's security are fundamental obstacles to achieving peace .
There can be no successful solution without the intervention of mediating powers .
France was the first to take diplomatic and humanitarian action .
The United States has involved itself by tabling a plan for settling the conflict , which unfortunately - if my information is correct - has just been rejected by Hizbollah .
Strictly speaking , France and the United States do not have the same position on the Middle East .
Their approach to the individual states in the region is different .
For this very reason , their respective actions , if coordinated , could greatly help to bring about a permanent solution .
With regard to Europe - or , more precisely , European political cooperation - as ever , it has been somewhat slow off the mark .
Europe 's institutions are more at issue here than the men and women who run them .
Will the negotiators at the Intergovernmental Conference remember this , in the pale light of dawn that always surrounds the final hours of Treaty negotiations ?
Mr President , I also want to address my remarks directly to the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Ferraris , to call for a more visible initiative by the European Union .
You have already heard colleagues in my group , the European United Left , firmly condemn the Hizbollah movement 's terrorist attacks against Israel .
Our group has always spoken out against the use of religious fundamentalism for political ends and even worse , as in this case , for terrorist ends .
We consider the Israeli response indiscriminate and disproportionate , decided on only to reassure public opinion on the eve of the parliamentary elections .
Israel cannot inflict the weight of its response to the Hizbollah attacks on the whole Lebanese people .
Furthermore , we consider that the attack against the whole of Lebanon is seriously endangering the Middle East peace process .
We therefore call for the immediate cessation of hostilities and the resumption of negotiations between Lebanon , Syria and Israel , with a view to lasting peace between these countries .
To conclude I want to tell you this , Mr Ferraris : you must understand that merely studying the situation is not enough , it is necessary to take action .
I think the Member States must take the initiative immediately on the basis of a decision of the Council of the European Union to secure a ceasefire and the resumption of negotiations .
Guaranteeing impunity to anyone , in any region of the world , can only lead to disaster .
Mr President , I should firstly like to say that I agree with many of the major points that Mrs Green and Mr Sakellariou have made about this conflict .
I shall therefore take this opportunity to make a number of other points , which may be minor ones , but which I believe need to be highlighted .
I had the opportunity to attend the Palestinian elections as an observer for the European Parliament .
Today , Yasser Arafat 's government and people are fighting terrorism .
And I heard a short while ago , at a meeting held in this very building , that the Israeli ambassador recognizes and welcomes this fact .
And I think it is clear that no one in this Chamber wishes to see a return to the logic of violence either .
The European Union has established , albeit timidly , a framework for dialogue .
It persuaded the Syrians and Israelis to sit down at the same table at the Barcelona Conference .
It played a fundamental role in the Palestinian elections .
Because everyone recognizes the right to self defence , but it is a right that must be exercised with complete and strict self restraint .
Here , we now have aggressive action on the part of the Israeli government , we have barbarous , foolish and dangerous acts .
And from that standpoint I think those acts should be condemned by the European Union , the United States , and by every international agency .
I was in Beirut last week on the day that the Israeli actions started .
It struck me in the airport that every hall had a portrait of the Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and his dead son .
It is quite clear that Syria is calling the shots in Lebanon .
Mr President , the Hizbollah 's actions from Lebanon can only , and I really mean only , be carried out with the approval and collaboration of Syria .
Then there would be no reason for Israel to take action outside its own frontiers .
Has the time not come for a real EU policy , for example on arms supplies ?
Finally , Mr President , did France take action after EU consultation or did they go it alone ?
And what do they hope to achieve in view of the American efforts ?
Without justice there is no life and no peace .
I urge the Hizbollah and their backers to stop firing on northern Israel , to call a halt to terrorism and to accept the offer of negotiations .
We want to amend point 5 of the resolution , which I believe would make it acceptable .
We Europeans believe in the peace process that Mr Rabin initiated , and we shall do everything in our power to ensure the success of that process .
Mr President , I agree with the feeling in this House that does not wish to polemicise .
This is about maintaining the peace process and the peace process is today at stake .
But there is a difference between taking action precisely to save the peace process or taking terrorist action to torpedo it .
I feel that this distinction must be clearly made .
There is a necessary and objective process of joint planning which can be an advantage but may also , as in this case , be a disadvantage of the European Union .
All this must be considered when intervention is described as too slow - although that is true , there is no denying it .
This is , I repeat , an extremely delicate issue , and if it is to be handled successfully I do not think everything can be made public . Sometimes matters have to be discussed with extreme caution .
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow .
Question Time ( Council )
The next item is Question Time to the Council ( B4-0431 / 96 ) .
I regret that we are down to one hour rather than the usual one and a half hours .
Therefore , I shall allow a supplementary question from the original questioner plus one other rather than the usual two .
Mr President , you have said the we have just one hour .
It is scandalous that it is reduced that way .
In fact we have only 48 minutes .
I beg you to present something to the presidency .
It is intolerable that one of the major rights of Parliament - to ask questions - is not being fulfilled .
It really is intolerable , what is happening now .
Mr von Habsburg , I am totally in agreement with you .
I constantly bring this matter up both in writing to the President and to the heads of the political groups .
I do not seem to be making much progress but perhaps together we can have another go .
I intend to have one hour of questions even though this goes beyond 7 p.m. I hope that the interpreters will be agreeable to this because it always depends on their cooperation .
But I think it would be difficult to give journalists the support Mr Bertens would like to them to have .
I assume that when Mr Bertens refers to crisis areas he means areas in a state of civil war , with a real war in progress . I imagine that is what he is referring to .
The Union provides all possible moral and political support , but I am fully aware that such support is symbolic rather than actual .
This coordination centre was to have a direct link with the European institutions to facilitate adequate political action .
I did this in conjunction with all international and national journalists ' organisations , and I am now asking you why I have not to date even received an acknowledgment of receipt .
I trust you will do something about that .
Thank you for that clarification , Mr Bertens , which is very useful indeed and I can only reply in all honesty that I take note of your request .
Question No 2 by Concepció Ferrer ( H-0211 / 96 )
Subject : Plan for joint action to combat racism and xenophobia
Given the fundamental differences between the UK and the other Member States regarding the plan for joint action to strengthen judicial cooperation in the area of combating racism ,
Does the Council intend to maintain the broad thrust of the initial plan ?
Does it not believe that the objectives of the proposed action would be difficult to achieve if the British position were to prevail ?
The text we proposed takes account of certain comments made by the United Kingdom delegation in particular and is broadly based on the plan examined by the Council in November 1995 .
This text is intended to establish legal cooperation on the instructions for drafting the leaflet on conduct that can be described as racist or xenophobic .
For its part , the Italian presidency will do everything possible to ensure that this plan can be approved before our presidency ends .
It goes without saying that we consider it the duty of every free citizen to condemn racism and xenophobia .
Thank you , Mr President-in-Office , for your answer to my question , which was in fact tabled before the Council adopted its decision .
Let us not forget that racism and xenophobia are a great problem , which requires action on the scale of that which the Council and , more specifically , the Italian presidency are in favour of taking .
Consequently , I simply wish to thank you for your answer and welcome the proposed action .
I am dismayed at the negative attitude of my own government .
Will the Council make every effort to try and persuade the British Government that we need to take action at the European level as well as anything else we do ?
Could I also ask the President-in-Office if the final decision on action in this area will be taken by unanimity or by a qualified majority ?
This time the honourable Member has me in difficulties , because I do not know the answer .
I say that sincerely .
I venture to suggest that a decision like this , condemning racism and xenophobia , would be unanimous .
It would be surprising if the fifteen were not unanimous on this subject .
I want to say that the presidency and the Council are aware that this decision alone cannot reduce racism and xenophobia .
It needs to be translated into action in prevention , in youth exchanges , in the Euro-Mediterranean project , and so on .
Ladies and gentlemen , our condemnation of racism and xenophobia cannot be limited to legislation to prevent it .
There is a need to promote moral action , because if the European Parliament and the European Union are not in a position to combat racism and xenophobia , they will be failing in one of their duties .
Question No 3 by Alexandros Alavanos ( H-0213 / 96 )
Subject : Position of the Council regarding the crisis between Greece and Turkey
Mr Alavanos ' question is also quite difficult and delicate at this time .
A little while ago Mr Alavanos quite rightly spoke about the importance of equilibrium in the Mediterranean .
He was referring to the Middle East and also recalling the difficulties between Greece and Turkey .
I thank Mr Ferraris and in every way echo the wishes he has expressed .
And I now want to make my question completely specific on the basis of recent developments , namely the failure to convene the Council of Association .
I ask for a specific answer from the President-in-Office .
Mr Alavanos is right in a sense , but if it were possible to give a more definite reply , the problem would already have been solved .
The difficulty actually lies in trying to identify the possibility of genuine terms for a solution between the two parties involved .
Question No 4 by Carmen Fraga Estévez ( H-0225 / 96 )
Subject : Decision by the US Court of International Trade
I do not think that would be correct . In general we believe that our Community legislation conforms to United Nations resolutions .
This proposal will be discussed at the next meeting of the Fisheries Council on 22 April 1996 , as I have already stated in replying to other questions three weeks ago .
In fact the Council has never had occasion up to now to discuss the specific facts mentioned in the question , so I do not think there is any more I can say in answer to Mrs Fraga Estévez .
I am grateful to the President-in-Office for his explanation , but I am obliged to say that the Council has been examining the Commission proposal and Parliament 's report for almost two years now .
It is therefore taking its time .
I hope that it reaches a successful conclusion .
Furthermore , I should like to ask the President-in-Office a question . The decision by the United States Court of International Trade is following an unstoppable course .
Given that the Italian Government has 30 days in which to reply , therefore , is the Italian Government prepared to submit such an action plan ?
And if so , what guideline measures will it contain ?
I would like to make two comments .
The first is a general one on your complaint about the delays , Mrs Fraga Estévez .
The second comment is that , in our opinion , our standards are in line with those of the United Nations and therefore I must infer that the attitude of the United States is wrong .
That question is put to me as an Italian and not as the representative of the presidency , so I will find out and make a point of giving you the details .
I was very surprised by the reply from the Presidentin-Office .
He said that the Council was not in the habit of commenting on the decisions of organizations other than itself .
If it decides to take no action , that will mean that it accepts the accusations .
In that case , it must resolve to put the Community 's house in order .
If it decides to take action , because it believes that the United States has violated world trade rules , then it will have to take the matter to the World Trade Organization .
My question is : does the Council intend to defend the Community 's fisheries exports by lodging a complaint against the United States with the World Trade Organization ?
Or does it , on the contrary , intend to accept the export ban ?
If that is the case , it will have to draw up a policy to ensure compliance with United Nations rules in the fisheries sector .
You are right in a sense , Mr Arias Cañete , but first I would like to make one thing clear .
Secondly , the actions of a United States court cannot have extra-territorial effect , they cannot have effect outside the United States .
In the third place it seems to us that these provisions , as they have been described , are incompatible with the decisions of the Uruguay Round on free trade .
So I would ask you not to press me any further and I will do what I can .
The Council is most grateful for the very specific information you have given me .
Question No 5 by Michl Ebner ( H-0233 / 96 )
Subject : Protection of minorities in Member States of the Union
I do not think it will be difficult for Mr Ebner to understand my thinking on the subject of what has been done by the Council and by Italy on the principle of respect for minority nationalities .
Count Ferraris , I am sincerely grateful both for what you have said and above all for what has been done in the past on this issue .
That is a great pity , and I believe that the demand made by the European Parliament in the Maij-Weggen / Dury report underlines this .
I think I can also say on behalf of the Council that this is non-discrimination : but that would be a long debate and I do not want to go into detail .
I would like to suggest that Parliament returns to this issue . It is true it was not mentioned , but that was for the sake of brevity , not out of ill will .
I think point 4.13 of Parliament 's resolution on Europe 's support for the recognition of cultural diversity ought to be taken up .
Personally I hope that Parliament will seek to bring up this point when participating in the Intergovernmental Conference , because it is an intrinsic part of the heritage of rights of European citizens .
Mr President-in-Office , your answers have been excellent , but I am afraid the same cannot be said of the situation itself .
If we added all of the national minorities or ethnic groups in the European Union together , particularly after enlargement , they would constitute the second-largest Member State .
This , then , is a very sizeable problem .
At the moment , the preamble to the Europe Agreements contains an obligation to protect minorities .
When these states accede to the Union , however , this obligation will cease to apply .
Otherwise many problems from central and eastern Europe will be imported into the European Union .
I have difficulty answering you , Mr Posselt , because I have already mentioned the importance of this issue in relation to the enlargement myself .
Let me repeat that we are at the start of an Intergovernmental Conference .
This is a very important point and it needs to be raised .
The European Parliament is associated with the work of the Intergovernmental Conference , so it can propose something along these lines and I am sure that the governments will have no difficulty accepting it .
Furthermore , speaking as an Italian - I think Mr Ebner gave me credit for this - I believe we have done everything possible .
Problems will never be entirely solved ; total satisfaction will never be possible !
Otherwise we would not be human , we would be divine .
Question No 6 by Christine Oddy ( H-0247 / 96 )
Subject : Sri Lanka
What steps does the Council intend to take to ensure that urgently required medical aid is sent to Northern Sri Lanka ?
I think I have already replied in the past to questions about Sri Lanka and my reply to Ms Oddy is that the European Union is very concerned .
I have the impression , alas , that the Union does not have great resources .
I can only hope that the parties will return to the negotiating table , but in situations of this kind it is fairly rare .
Both sides must be willing to negotiate and this does not seem to me to be the case in very tragic conflict situations like the one in Sri Lanka .
I visited Sri Lanka from 1-5 April and met Joe Green , the Commission representative out there , who was very helpful .
He is under-resourced and this is bringing the European Union into disrepute at present .
There are three problems which I have now identified and I would like the Council 's views on them .
Firstly , a number of important supplies , such as medicine , which could help the LTTE , are banned from the north .
This affects children , elderly people and the disabled .
Can the Council use its good offices to ensure that civilians do not suffer from lack of medical assistance ?
Secondly , there is a drought in the country and it is feared that there could be a severe shortage of food in a few months ' time .
Again , will the Council comment on emergency preparations in place if that should transpire ?
Thirdly , there is a problem of lack of independent , objective assessment of the situation and suffering of civilians in the north .
Will the Council try to ensure that the ECHO office visits as soon as possible ?
You are right , Ms Oddy .
I can see that you probably know better than anyone that Sri Lanka recently reintroduced a state of emergency .
It is my opinion , finally , that the Union , the presidency and the Council are unfortunately powerless in the face of this tragic situation .
Question No 7 by María Izquierdo Rojo ( H-0252 / 96 )
Subject : Blocking of the MEDA regulation by one of the 15 Member States
Thank you , Mr President-in-Office , for your reply , which nevertheless directly contradicts what the European public has been told .
The answer you have just given me is new and contradictory , and is only comprehensible because of the lack of transparency in the debates of the Council .
The Member State which is blocking the regulation - the United Kingdom - has still not given an explanation .
Mr President-in-Office , could you please convey the fact to the UK Government that we are demanding an explanation for its obstructive stance , which is a gratuitous one that is holding up all the Mediterranean programmes ?
We want a clear and public explanation .
It is prejudicing the Mediterranean region , and in my view is based on an attempt to oppose the Mediterranean and the East in a way which has already been overtaken by events .
We demand an explanation .
I can give you the answers you want right away , Mrs Izquierdo .
I am afraid your information was not correct because the problem that existed with the United Kingdom has been resolved .
I am sorry to contradict you , but it has been resolved .
An accommodation was reached through the good offices of the presidency , and as a result there is now political agreement between all the Member States .
Only one difficulty remains and it was raised at the General Affairs Council last month . It relates to a conflict situation which a Member State thought should be taken into consideration .
Question No 8 by Per Gahrton ( H-0255 / 96 )
Subject : Openness and forms of decision-making during the Intergovernmental Conference
I believe this problem about methods was discussed in the plenary session of this Parliament a few days ago .
So I think this question probably predates the understanding adopted and then approved in Turin on 29 March .
Let me just remind you briefly that Parliament is invited , through both the presidency and Parliament 's own representatives , to join in the process of decision-making at the Intergovernmental Conference .
This is being vigorously promoted in cooperation with Parliament .
I think the solution adopted takes account of two aspects .
We hope that the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference will be advantageous to Europe and that these assumptions will be respected .
This is not a question of the European Parliament 's participation in the Intergovernmental Conference .
It is a question of public access for citizens and journalists to the documents on which discussions and decisions at the IGC are based .
It is a question of whether minutes are kept and whether those minutes are publicly accessible .
I did not unfortunately receive an answer to this question .
This conference stands alone , whatever level it develops at ; it is sovereign and it is therefore perfectly free to choose the working methods it considers most appropriate .
I am not prepared to take that supplementary , because it referred to the previous question .
Question No 9 by Peter Crampton ( H-0261 / 96 )
Subject : Hong Kong
Could the Council explain the steps it is taking to allow British National Overseas Dependent Territories Passport holders free movement in the European Union ?
The Member States will have this power until the Council has completed the relevant harmonization .
I feel that the Council could make an exception here and talk about citizenship rather earlier .
I am sure they could do something and they would appreciate the position of these people who are rather different from third country nationals . They have British passports .
I would ask the Council to speed up the process . I thank it for what it has done on visas but this is something that needs rather more speedy attention .
I am sorry , Mr Crampton , but that is the information I have .
This seems to be a very complex matter .
But if the information is wrong , the presidency will be very pleased to receive clarification and further details from you .
That concludes Question Time .
( The sitting was closed at 7.10 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
At the Conference of Presidents last week it was agreed that the statement would be made , to be followed by 30 minutes of questions without a speaking list .
Anybody who looks at the agenda as published will see that it says quite clearly ' Statement by the Commission on BSE , ...
followed by 30 minutes of questions ' .
We are notified this afternoon that this procedure has been changed and that speaking lists have been submitted and been requested by other groups .
That is absolutely unacceptable .
I do not know who has changed it .
The agreement in the Conference of Presidents was clear .
I think we should first of all deal with the agenda , that is , the first item on the agenda .
As soon as that subject has been dealt with I shall ask the Assembly , which is sovereign , whether or not it wishes to accept Mrs Green 's proposal .
I think that is the proper procedure to follow .
Mr President , I have to say that is manipulation of the worst sort .
It is perfectly acceptable for you to make that decision now , given the time of day that it is , given the fact that my group has prepared for this discussion tonight without a speaking list .
You are now saying that we should stay here and wait until this first debate is finished before that decision is made .
That is not acceptable , Mr President . In the spirit of good will and the way this Parliament operates , we could take that decision now .
There is no reason why we should not .
I ask you to take the decision now , Mr President !
I think it is possible to decide now too , but to stick to the agenda which has been laid down .
First we deal with the subject which was on the agenda and then , as the second subject , under the procedure laid down by Parliament , the other matter will have to be dealt with .
( The President cut the speaker off )
We shall decide quickly the procedure on the list of speakers , but the discussion on this matter must follow the order laid down by Parliament and its services .
Is that agreed ?
Mr President , our group is under the same understanding as Mrs Green .
That should take place now and that should have precedence over the items on the agenda which , it was generally understood , would follow after this one-hour debate .
I am saying that we should decide quickly whether the speakers are to be called upon on the basis of a list or on an impromptu basis .
In any case as there is another item first we cannot upset the agenda .
So let us follow the normal procedure .
Mr President , I agree with Mrs Green , as my colleagues no doubt do as well .
I would ask , however , that questions should not extend beyond two minutes , to ensure that the maximum possible number of Members are given the chance of putting a question .
One minute would be even better .
The agenda cannot be amended , amongst other things because Rule 96 of the Rules of Procedure says clearly that once adopted the agenda may not be amended .
( Parliament agreed to the proposal )
Mr President , I thank you very much for your cooperation .
As you will be in the Chair , I am sure it will be an extremely good session .
It always has been !
The Rules of Procedure themselves do not provide for a list , but there has always been fair play on the part of the Members in presenting it .
You are therefore fully entitled to make your request .
Mr President , I have a further point of order .
There has seldom been a discussion for which it has been so important to have the Commissioner responsible present in the House .
Could you please ascertain , at the start of our discussion of the item on BSE , why Mr Fischler is not present ?
We need him to give us a clear statement .
I do not wish to imply any lack of respect for his deputies , but we do need a clear and unambiguous statement from Mr Fischler himself .
I must say that it is not necessary for the Commissioner to be here , because we are dealing with another matter .
Let us proceed calmly and with due order !
Visby Summit
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions :
Mr President , the Baltic region has been a region without common hope for the future , with an iron curtain on land and out at sea .
Now , however , the region is busy developing the same flourishing cooperation which brought the region as a whole considerable prosperity before the communist takeover .
The Council of Baltic Sea States can play an important role here and the European Union 's involvement is of considerable importance too .
Four of the countries in the Council of Baltic Sea States are Members of the European Union .
Four countries - Poland and the three Baltic republics - have Europe Agreements and have applied for full membership .
The other countries in the Council of Baltic Sea States , among which Russia should receive special mention , have agreements with the EU on more or less long-term cooperation .
The Baltic region is the EU 's nordic dimension .
The Commission is itself a member of the Council of Baltic Sea States .
Though cooperation in the region is promising , there are still threats and challenges : the European Union has a land border with Russia in the north .
The Kaliningrad region is surrounded by countries which have applied for membership of the Union .
Economic zones meet out in the Baltic Sea .
The situation as regards security policy is unstable because the political future of Russia is so uncertain .
The battle against organised crime is on the agenda . The greatest opportunities for further cooperation lie in the economic field .
Shortly before Visby a meeting will be held in Stockholm with prominent business leaders from all the countries in the Baltic region ; at the meeting a special declaration is to be adopted .
The Baltic states and Poland must make considerable efforts of their own to reform their economies and political systems with the aim of acceding to the Union .
The EU has every reason to support regional cooperation around the Baltic Sea economically and politically .
Greater Baltic cooperation will facilitate a rapid enlargement of the European Union to include Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland .
The Baltic region should once again be able to become a flourishing region for trade , investment and tourism .
Vigorous economic action is required from the EU for the environmental clean-up of discharge sources and to improve the marine environment of the Baltic .
The EU 's support system can definitely be used better to ensure the sustainable development of the Baltic Sea region .
The European Parliament has shown great interest in Baltic cooperation and issues concerning the Baltic have been debated here on many occasions .
We should have had the opportunity to participate in a dialogue on these issues sooner .
Mr President , the Baltic Sea area is turning into a northern extension of the European Union stretching far towards the Arctic Ocean .
All 11 states in the area are either members of the European Union or are linked to it by special agreements .
At present , economic support targeted at the Baltic area is still only weakly coordinated in the Union .
The Greens in the European Parliament call for the Commission to develop an integrated Baltic programme .
It need not think that it would have to start building up such a programme from scratch , for cooperation has been established in the area for a long time and is indeed based on a centuries-old tradition .
The region 's own expertise and existing development programmes should be exploited and an attempt made to coordinate them .
Close cooperation particularly in the framework of the Baltic Council is now important because this body might become the region 's most important political coordinator .
The Baltic region also needs to build up a comprehensive environment programme on the basis of sustainable development .
Helcom has an operational programme currently in force and this could certainly be used as a basis for a more ambitious plan than in the past .
The Commission 's task is above all to ensure that it has sufficient international funding .
The Commission is due to assume the presidency of Helcom at the beginning of July and this will provide an excellent opportunity , nay , an obligation , to carry out this task .
A very critical attitude needs to be taken to them and an attempt must be made to support environmentally acceptable solutions .
The region has considerable energy resources , even though it also has major problems .
In this new initiative which the Commission has proposed , all the various points of view , from environmental policy to security issues and economic development , should be brought together .
Mr President , the initiative adopted by the Commission to reinforce the stability and economic development of the Baltic Sea area is welcome .
The Commission is not offering any new resources , but is proposing a better exploitation of current cooperation and programmes .
There are good reasons for starting from this point : established forms of cooperation must be fully exploited .
The Commission proposal contains concrete projects in the energy field .
It notes that the crude oil pipeline from Russia to Finland , together with the linking of the EU 's and the associated countries ' electricity and gas networks , should be a subject of development .
By way of example , the Commission mentions the Baltic Electricity Ring which was adopted at Parliament 's suggestion as one of the list of energy networks in the Community interest .
The Commission 's new initiative will only be sufficiently comprehensive if it also includes a concrete opinion on the development of the gas network .
Simply having a positive attitude to this issue is not sufficient .
The development of the northern European gas network received the support of the European Parliament and Council Conciliation Committee .
In conciliation on energy networks Parliament 's proposal for a northern gas network - the Nordic Gas Grid project - was unfortunately omitted from the project list .
I should therefore like to propose , in paragraph 7 of the resolution due to be adopted tomorrow , a wording which reflects the current state of the project .
In Amendment No 6 I propose that the Nordic Gas Grid project be included as soon as possible on the list of Europe-wide projects in the common interest .
The Finnish Members of the European Parliament were unanimous on this point .
Mr President , the Group of the European Radical Alliance supports the resolution on the forthcoming summit on the Baltic Sea , for reasons which I shall outline briefly .
The countries bordering the Baltic differ from each other and in their relations with the European Union .
It is heartening that the Baltic Sea summit should provide a forum where these countries can forget their differences in order to launch new initiatives for working together .
Parliament has , on several occasions , pointed out the need to bring about practical Baltic cooperation .
New Member States , more applicant countries , everything already points in the same direction , as other colleagues have stressed .
It is necessary to stimulate regional cooperation .
The historical changes alone require this .
The differences are not really that great as yet .
The experience gained from our Baltic inter-parliamentary delegations should provide Parliament with a basis to support such a development .
In that way the region 's identity as an independent but very active part of Europe is strengthened .
The Council and the Commission must follow up the Visby meeting and ensure that hope , strength and faith in the future is given to the peoples around the Baltic Sea .
I would like to begin by saying that I have a lot of sympathy for the amendments tabled by Mrs Hautala and Mrs Stenius-Kaukonen , but the principal matter is the joint motion for a resolution .
It is not perfect , but it works without any supranational suprstructure .
This is shown most clearly by a number of provisions .
The English version thus refers to the Northern dimension of the European Union .
I should be tempted to discuss with Mr Krarup whether or not there have been wars in the Baltic region , but that is not the subject this evening .
At that time the Ministers approved the accession of Finland and Sweden to the Union and the conclusion of agreements with Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
Moreover the Danzig Declaration referred to the cross-frontier dimension and the possible forms of financial aid in the framework of the PHARE and TACIS programmes .
I wanted to quote the Danzig Declaration in the trust and conviction that at Visby too there would be the same approval of that link , that relationship between the European Union and the Council of the Baltic countries .
I should like to point out that the Union supports regional cooperation initiatives in Europe .
Supporting them is , I would say , almost a Union policy .
As far as we understand , this Commission proposal will be ready this month , April .
In any case , Commissioner Van den Broek will be able to tell you much more .
Finally I should like also to mention the other initiatives which the Union has taken as regards the region of the Baltic countries .
Thus the initiative , from being four-sided , became hexagonal simply because Poland was involved .
Finally the political dialogue between the European Union and the European Economic Area - Norway , Iceland and Liechtenstein - involves countries which are more or less in the Baltic area .
A meeting at ministerial level is also being considered to give it greater moment .
Those were not just formal engagements , however important those may be , and I would remind you that the foreign ministers of those countries had been invited to Turin together with those of the other applicant countries .
The interest expressed by the Members present here who are particularly close to the Baltic region , in particular those of Sweden and Denmark , show that the region is not forgotten by the Union .
Cooperation in the regions is developing speedily and the Commission feels that it has a contribution to make there , and is so doing .
These documents give an overview of the region 's potential , of cooperation activities and of the financial instruments .
The initiative was presented using the existing financial funds , which are , as far as the Commission is concerned , the PHARE programme , the TACIS programme ad the INTERREG programme .
It is also expected that the international financial institutions , including the European Investment Bank , will also grant aid .
Additional financing is therefore not required in our view .
The Baltic region is a region with many opportunities and great potential as regards natural resources , production and trade , with a total population of around 60 million .
The Baltic region is also a region of considerable importance as regards security policy ; it could play an important role in establishing good relations and closer cooperation between the European Union , the former Soviet states and Russia .
Nevertheless , common initiatives and efforts are required from both the Baltic States themselves and from the European Union if democratic and economic development in the region is to be fostered .
A strategy of this kind is in accordance with the new , expanded concept of security which we must all accept .
An active and effective security policy must above all seek to counter the threats which have their origins in social , economic and ecological problems .
Military alliances and investment in military resources can never be the prime method of ensuring security and safety .
I therefore urge the Commission to submit practical proposals at the summit on these areas and thereby help make the outcome of the meeting as substantive as possible .
Finally , it is important to stress that we should not regard this Baltic Sea initiative as competing with the Mediterranean programme .
There is no conflict between these two areas of regional cooperation in Europe .
Both are equally important for the achievement of harmonious and peaceful development in Europe .
Mr President , at the beginning of May the heirs to the Hanseatic League will be holding a summit meeting in Visby at which the discussion will include promoting the development of the area 's economy .
For this meeting the Commission has drawn up its cooperation initiative for the Baltic Sea area , through which it will attempt to support the area 's development in a wide variety of ways .
By means of the same programme the Commission undertakes to promote the achievement of free trade in the framework of the Central European Free Trade Agreement between the Baltic states and Poland .
The Commission quite rightly draws attention to the important role of small and medium-sized undertakings in promoting trade cooperation .
In order to improve their trading conditions the Commission is cooperating with the international financial institutions with a view , inter alia , to founding a Baltic business council .
The Commission also considers it important to link the Union 's electricity and gas networks to the corresponding networks in the associated countries , such as the Baltic electricity network .
This gas network permits a good level of security of supply which will benefit not only the Baltic region but the whole of Europe .
It is to be hoped that the Visby summit will extend the gas network list in this sense .
Mr President , I should like to put forward two points which I think are important .
First of all the Council and Commission must remember that the Barents sea area is a vital part of the Baltic region .
The Barents Euro-Arctic Council must be given an equal position with the Council of Baltic States .
The Union must also participate more actively than hitherto in the development of the Barents sea area .
According to current plans the EU is developing into a tight economic , political and even military union from which only Russia will be excluded .
There is thus a serious contradiction between the Union 's declared and de facto objectives .
To ensure the favourable development of the Baltic region it is necessary to create pan-European cooperation in which Russia too has an equal part .
In principle this could be done either by accepting Russia too as an EU Member State or by turning the Council of Europe into a strong pan-European cooperation umbrella .
Both alternatives would mean in practice that Europe would be made up of several cooperation areas which each state would contribute to unifying under its own conditions and at its own speed .
I hope that we can promote a realistic discussion about the future of Europe as a whole on the basis of these alternatives .
The Union is already involved in the work of the Barents EuroArctic Council .
Three Member States , Denmark , Sweden and Finland will be joining this Arctic Council scheduled to be set up in June .
It is regrettable that given the importance of the summit there is not some representation from the European Parliament .
The EU has a partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia .
The EU has a direct interest in the matters under discussion at Visby .
The EU is already playing a key role in encouraging better regional cooperation between the Baltic Sea states .
The EU is committed to countering pollution in the Baltic Sea and ensuring the safety of nuclear plants and installations .
Through TACIS , PHARE and INTERREG the EU is assisting the economic and political reform process in the former Soviet bloc .
Controlling the growth of crime and the Mafia will be vital as the EU expands .
However , the EU should be careful that it does not stimulate unrealistic expectations amongst the Baltic Sea states .
EU entry for Poland and the Baltic states will not happen overnight .
The EU and the applicant states have much to prepare before enlargement can take place .
Obvious examples are the reform of the CAP and structural funds and reform of the EU 's decision-making structures .
Economically , legally and socially , Poland , and especially the Baltic States still have much ground to make up .
Further work needs to be done to guarantee the rights of Russian-speaking minorities in Estonia and Latvia .
Realism is necessary today to prevent bitter disappointment and disillusionment tomorrow .
Other security mechanisms must be found : for example , the reformed WEU and a revitalized OSCE .
Security cooperation with Russia , through NATO , also requires further work .
I hope that the summit at Visby will take place in a spirit of positive , but realistic cooperation .
I should like to mention by way of a rider that I feel that the House has been treated somewhat with contempt today because this Baltic debate has been put back by four hours .
We had been expecting a statement from Commissioner Fischler at 5 p.m. , 9 p.m. , and now 10 p.m. I do not think this is the proper way for Parliament to be run .
Furthermore , I think it is treating the Members of this House and the millions of people that they collectively represent with contempt .
I hope it will not reoccur .
Mr President , the major change in Europe over the past few years has significantly affected the position of the states in the Baltic sea area .
Finland and Sweden have joined the European Union following the breakdown of Europe 's ideological and military division .
The Baltic countries and Poland , having regained their independence , have concluded association agreements with the EU with a view to membership .
Russia is seeking its way towards democracy and the market economy .
A cooperation and partnership agreement has been negotiated between the EU and Russia which should hopefully enter into force this year .
It is important that all the regions in the Baltic area should take part in the Visby Summit and that the European Union should have a strong presence there .
Hopefully the meeting will mark the beginning of cooperation founded on the participation , equality and mutual respect of all parties .
The main objective of the Visby conference will naturally enough be strengthening democratic and economic development in the area .
Similarly the meeting is expected to send a positive message about EU enlargement .
It is also essential to give further impetus to concrete projects on the environment , transport and energy networks .
We also support the inclusion on the list of Europe-wide gas networks the one linking Russia 's and Norway 's gas resources .
In the Baltic region there is a need for cooperation based on respect for the independence of all the countries in the areas .
At the same time emphasis must be placed on the protection of the rule of law and minority rights in the states of the region .
The Baltic countries and Poland have expressed their wish to join not only the European Union but also the European security systems .
It needs to be stated plainly that the legitimate security interests of these countries must be taken seriously .
The Baltic states must not be left in the lurch .
At the same time , security solutions must be such as to increase the stability of the whole Baltic region .
Mr President , the speeches of honourable Members in the last round have raised one or two points on which I should like to make a few remarks .
Mrs Theorin and Mrs Iivari in particular spoke of security and also of security organizations with regard to the Baltic .
I can also say that at the time the association of these countries with the WEU was an Italian initiative .
I think that should be remembered .
Strangely enough , the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the WEU , Sir Dudley Smith , is in Rome today and will in fact be holding discussions .
Mr Väyrinen and Mrs Iivari have also spoken of minorities , a matter which we discussed this afternoon in reply to a question from Mr Ebner .
We may therefore refer to what was said particularly as regards the European countries which are Members of the Union .
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at noon tomorrow .
Commission statement on BSE
The next item is the statement by the Commission on BSE , including the financial aspects .
However , let me first of all say a few words of explanation concerning the remarks I made at the weekend about British beef .
The Commission has never said that British beef is unsafe .
The first doubts over the safety of British beef arose as a result of the statement made by the British Government in the British House of Commons .
This was based on Article 43 of the EC Treaty , which the Court of Justice has interpreted as extending to health issues , where these are connected with agriculture .
And I cannot see any reason why I should behave differently from a British farmer , for example , or a British worker .
So I entirely fail to understand why I should be criticized on precisely these grounds by the British National Farmers ' Union - unless perhaps it is part of some strategy for restoring consumer confidence ?
And in any event , my comments make no difference whatever to the fact that the Commission was entirely within its rights in deciding to prohibit for the time being all exports of British beef and beef products .
Our intention was , and still is , to eliminate any possible risk for the consumer .
But let us return to my starting-point .
The committee took the view that these measures were important , in that they reduced the risk of coming into contact with the infective agent which causes BSE .
However , it added that this threat should be further reduced by removing from the food chain all those animals which had had any probable contact with the agent .
Fifthly , the veterinary services in the United Kingdom will step up their inspections to ensure that controls on the identification and destruction of cattle are in fact being scrupulously carried out .
Within the next few weeks , the Commission will send an inspection team to the United Kingdom , including experts from the other Member States .
This team will have the task of checking on the implementation of the measures which have already been adopted .
On 9 April , the Veterinary Standing Committee again reviewed the whole body of scientific knowledge on rendering the infective agent inactive in the course of tallow and gelatine production .
Besides issuing a number of other recommendations , the WHO experts took the view that gelatine and tallow are quite safe , provided certain processing methods are applied .
In addition , the Scientific Committee of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency met in London on 15 and 16 April .
The committee made it clear in its recommendations that in the manufacture of gelatine for medicinal purposes , raw materials should be used that were not of British origin .
However , we are not only concerned with health and veterinary measures ; as you know , we also have a tremendous marketing problem to solve .
Since the BSE crisis came to a head , the marketing of beef products throughout the Community has become a very serious problem .
But there is only one way to bring about this stabilization of the market , which all of us are striving for and wish to see .
Consumers are rightly demanding assurances that the meat they are eating is absolutely safe and will not harm their health .
Stabilization of the market cannot be achieved simply by intervention buying , because what we put into store today we shall have to sell again tomorrow .
On this basis , stabilization of the market cannot realistically be achieved unless we can offer our consumers , without hesitation , further guarantees as to the safety of our beef .
This plan was in fact agreed by the Management Committee last week , and is to be adopted by the Commission by written procedure in the course of this week .
Apart from these measures , which are intended to help restore consumer confidence , the Commission is also supporting farmers in the other Member States .
Further to the special Council meeting in Luxembourg , it was decided by the Management Committee to bring forward the opening of intervention and at the same time to increase carcass weights .
Last week , the Commission put before the Management Committee a proposal for a procedure without weight limits and covering additional quality grades .
I know that the United Kingdom Government has been discussing this matter intensively in the past few days .
The Agriculture Minister , Mr Hogg , speaking yesterday in the House of Commons , emphatically denied that any such programme would have to involve hundreds of thousands of animals .
Rather , those animals which present the greatest risk of infection should be identified systematically ; destroying them would ensure a significant reduction in the incidence of new cases of BSE .
We are now expecting to receive specific proposals from the British Government at any time .
In accordance with the conclusions of the special Council meeting on BSE , the Commission will keep the Council and the European Parliament regularly informed on the question of BSE .
I am now providing Parliament with the first of our reports on this matter , and will submit a full report to the Council at its meeting on 29 and 30 April .
We can , however , make estimates for the following measures .
Firstly , the removal from the food chain of animals over 30 months old .
We are assuming that in 1996 , 400 000 cattle will be covered by this scheme , and 800 000 in 1997 .
At a price of ECU 392 per head , the Community budget will have to face expenditure in the region of ECU 160 million in 1996 and ECU 320 m in 1997 .
These figures are based on a Community contribution of 70 % .
The costs of the disposal of carcasses must be borne by the United Kingdom alone .
Secondly , the programme on calves will cost - and this figure applies only to 1996 - in the region of ECU 50 m .
In this context , perhaps I could say a few words on the revision of the financial perspective .
On the basis of the present data , the Commission takes the view that our proposal remains justified in its approach .
However , we must concede that as a result of the BSE crisis , our anticipated margin for 1997 has been significantly reduced .
Finally , I should like to report briefly on the discussions which I had last week with Professor Weissmann of Switzerland and Professor Collins of the United Kingdom .
I have invited Professor Weissmann to chair an advisory group of scientific experts , whose members are specialists in BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease .
This advisory group will keep us up to date on the state of research and on future research requirements .
I understand that Professor Weissmann and his working group will be able to provide us with appropriate recommendations in the autumn .
Commissioner , I think that in the financial estimates promotion of meat consumption must be discussed .
It seems to me not only a British but a European problem .
Mr President , I am glad to be able to answer that .
It is quite true that the Commission intends to help stimulate the beef market .
Finally , we believe that we must choose the right moment for starting such action very carefully , because if we were to choose the wrong time , whatever we do might well be counter-productive .
Thank you , Commissioner , for being here tonight because I know you have had a very hard day and you have met many groups in Parliament .
I hope you have had a good dinner .
It is important we recognize this as a European problem .
The Dutch have entered into a slaughtering system for which , I understand , there is going to be Community money available .
The UK is proposing a slaughter policy which will require some European money .
Is it your intention as Commissioner to develop a European policy to eliminate BSE throughout the Community ?
I am thinking particularly of a country in the south of Europe which has had over 30 cases which are completely unconnected to the British problem .
I hope , therefore , that you can clarify that position .
You might also say something about pharmaceutical products , because of the provisions which allow pharmaceutical products to continue to be traded within the European Community that contain gelatine .
Mr President , I shall be glad to take your admonitions seriously and keep my remarks as brief as possible .
Firstly , as regards calves , it is true that in the Netherlands at the present time , calves are being slaughtered which originated in the United Kingdom .
However , I would point out that this measure does not represent a health requirement , but is one initiated by the Netherlands .
In view of the marketing problems involved , however , the Council has decided to give these measures some support as well .
But we cannot pretend that the answer is simply a matter of saying that the more animals we have slaughtered , the better .
We must also look at the targeting and effectiveness of our measures , and that is why it is now critical that we receive an appropriate proposal from the United Kingdom .
As for the measures taken in other Member States , the herds in which cases of BSE have appeared have so far been slaughtered as far as possible .
There have only been a few cases , and the Commission is also ready to discuss the cases which are still pending or to help with slaughter in those cases too .
As regards the further spread of this disease , I may have misunderstood the question .
At any rate , there is no evidence that the disease has spread into 30 countries .
Mr President , I thank you for calling the Member who represents both Aberdeen and Angus !
We are very hoping that the ban on UK beef can be lifted globally and we are all united on that .
Would the Commission therefore give serious consideration to any such programme were this to be brought forward from the UK for Scotland and Northern Ireland ?
If such a scheme were brought forward , what conditions would have to be met ?
For example , there is talk of cow passports .
Over and above this , a question of differentiation or regionalization is emerging , on the basis of comparisons with previous control measures .
The crucial point will always be the adequacy of controls .
That is why the British Government has announced that proposals are also to be submitted in this respect .
In the first place , however , it is up to the British Government to put forward proposals of this kind , and as soon as such proposals are available , the Commission will of course assess them .
Commissioner , you said that confidence among consumers must be created through measures to guarantee health .
Do you think that a sweeping statement that British beef is safe represents that kind of measure ?
My second question is this : if , as you say , you cannot stabilize the market in terms of quantity , then why are you withdrawing 50 000 tonnes just when the debate is at its height ?
Whether it is actually safe or not , that meat is going to be forever tainted .
My third point is that you referred to selection or culling .
I would agree that even in Britain , not all the animals are sick , and not all their meat is bad .
Will the Commission put any effort into this aspect of the problem , and has Professor Weissmann made any proposals for tests to be carried out on live or slaughtered animals ?
There is a heated debate on this question at present .
Could not the Commission make some contribution here ?
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , in reply to your comments about market measures , I said that intervention in itself could never solve the problem .
But that does not mean that the statement can be turned on its head and taken to mean that we should - or could - abandon intervention altogether .
All these factors , in my view , justify us taking action now .
If we wait until the market has totally collapsed , that will not do anyone any good .
With regard to tests on live animals , Professor Weissmann has told me that at present , there is no reliable procedure for carrying out tests of this kind .
This means that entirely new designs for testing procedures must be developed - assuming , that is , that such a thing is possible at all .
Mr President , following on the Commissioner 's earlier remarks , you are very welcome to visit Ireland where our beef is grass-fed as you know .
This is environmentally friendly , safe food of very high quality .
But you know we are currently suffering because of the controversy .
You gave some assurances earlier today at some meetings and perhaps you would clarify for all of us what exactly you said .
We needed this warning , however , in order to be made aware of the dangers connected with this disease .
Mr President , I am grateful to the Commissioner for his reminder that the UK government has not yet put any proposals on the table .
How does he intend to tackle this ?
As I have already explained , all these considerations and proposals must be based on comprehensible control mechanisms .
This is an essential precondition , because otherwise we shall never gain the confidence which has been mentioned .
However , I also feel that our initial efforts must above all build on those measures which have already been introduced .
I do not think it has really been made sufficiently clear to public opinion what enormous changes have been made in our procedures in the course of these last few weeks .
Equally , it must be remembered that the parts known as SBOs are now being removed from younger animals as well , and carefully disposed of .
These are major changes geared to public safety and confidence , and they should be put across much more strongly , because of the far-reaching effect they will have .
It seems to me that one cannot rely on the idea of each of us saying in turn : ' But my cattle are not infected . They have never been in contact . '
That would just be making things too easy for ourselves .
We must try to bring about an overall solution to the problem .
Many times , the Commissioner used the words : probably , gelatine for the time being , and other suchlike .
From that point of view I fear that the mistake made by the British government during the past decade may be being repeated .
I would like to ask the Commissioner : for example , today , the expedient of slaughter is to be used as a protective measure .
But on the basis of the scientific information available to the Commission , is it certain that BSE is not transmitted via the soil or via slaughter-houses ?
Might it not be important and positive , besides the information we have from the Commissioner responsible for agricultural policy , to obtain information as well from the Commissioners responsible for public health and for research ?
Consequently , the deciding factor is this : can one or can one not eradicate these doubtful tissues or parts in every case ?
That is one of the crucial points .
As regards the mechanism for the disease spreading via the floor , I must confess that I really cannot imagine how that is going to happen in practice .
We should not forget that , when it comes to the general point at issue .
In view of the lack of time , I shall simply ask two questions .
Do you not agree , Commissioner , that in the long run , it would be wiser to abandon intervention in the case of British beef ?
What I personally fear is that if this meat comes back on the market in the future , there will again be difficulties .
And there is another problem : the at-risk imported cattle which have gone to other countries should now also be looked at closely .
Will there be slaughtering programmes here too ?
I am sure you cannot read all the many press reports , even those in Germany .
As for the reports in the media , it often happens , unfortunately , that a number of journalists simply copy from one another , and in the process two things are frequently entangled .
The first is that there is of course a clear basis in law for the Commission 's decisions , and this forms what might be called the judicial background to this decision .
Commissioner , I shall be very brief in order to allow my other colleagues time to speak .
I should like to know if you intend to bring proceedings before the Court of Justice against the companies which manufactured these products , so that those responsible have to bear the costs , rather than consumers .
Proceedings are only brought before the Court of Justice by the Commission when clear breaches of EU laws have taken place .
I understand , though , that you have a list from some groups that you are using as an orientation for your choice .
I think that is not playing by the rules .
I am following the rules , except that Members all raised their hands at the same time .
What would you have done ?
Mr President , we are all concerned on this side of the House about the magnitude of the crisis .
Let me be clear .
We want this ban to end .
I received a telephone call yesterday from the British Agriculture Minister during which he informed me that he intended to come to Brussels next Tuesday and would present his proposals then .
Commissioner , the damage has been done .
But the fault lies with the companies - for the most part international companies - which produced the contaminated feed .
Everywhere , the law says that the guilty party should pay compensation . My question is therefore simple .
All I am asking for is three lists of names .
Under Articles 129 and 129a of the Treaty on European Union , you are obliged to make such information freely available to all European citizens .
As regards the manufacturing of animal feeds , there are several provisions which have been adopted over the years .
All the same , we have to take it that this ban is not always obeyed .
For several years , there has been a total ban on feeding ruminants meal which is itself derived from ruminants .
I have already indicated that this ban is unfortunately not always obeyed , but to bring the producer before the courts for that reason seems impossible to me , in legal terms .
The special Council meeting has now decided on three additional safety measures .
Firstly , this ban must be made clear , and it must be made clear once and for all that feeding animal meal to herbivores remains prohibited .
We are taking it for granted that everyone can read .
Mr President , Commissioner , I think that we must analyse this issue with some realism .
But , for me , the most important thing , Commissioner , in this pact of confidence is winning over consumers and consumer associations .
Perhaps I can compensate for the length of my statement to some extent by answering what you have just said with a simple and sincere yes .
Mr President , the restoration of consumer confidence in beef is central to this particular issue .
I would like to ask the Commissioner if he will implement an effective promotional campaign in relation to beef and also a factual , credible information campaign for consumers ?
I would also like to acknowledge the fact that he recognizes that we have a special problem in Ireland .
I would ask him to respond in a positive manner to that particular crisis .
We are dependent on exports .
Up to 90 % of our beef is exported .
I think the Commissioner is doing a very good job in what is an extremely difficult situation .
It seems to me that the questions are starting to become somewhat repetitive , Mr Hyland .
I have already provided the information asked for in your first question , and would prefer not to repeat myself .
As regards your second question about the particular situation in Ireland , we know that Ireland depends on exports , that is quite clear .
Mr President , as the Commissioner said , there are still many unknown factors surrounding BSE .
We shall certainly make a further sum available , Mr Mulder , if it is necessary and wise to do so .
But we are thinking in the first place of making the BSE question a central focus for research , and will give BSE a correspondingly high priority in the allocation of resources to research projects .
Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his frank and straightforward statement .
I would like to point out that I have already answered this question too .
Has the Commission been informed by the United Kingdom Government of the destruction and disposal methods it proposes to adopt , and are these considered to be safe enough ?
We have been informed of the statement that was made in the House of Commons yesterday , and the Minister for Agriculture , Mr Hogg , also faxed his statement through to me .
There has been personal contact with the British Government .
The British experts have reported to various committees , including in particular the Standing Veterinary Committee .
As I have already stated , there will be a further meeting with the British Minister next week .
The main purpose of all these meetings is to allow us to discuss together the specific measures and decisions which must now be adopted .
I am closing the discussion on this question here , because forty minutes have gone by rather than thirty .
I am very sorry , but I think that on such an important and sensitive subject we shall have other occasions for everybody to speak .
It may be possible to arrange for us to continue today 's discussion next Tuesday .
As everyone asked to speak at the same time , naturally we have not been able to satisfy all requests .
I hope you could pass on those remarks to the rest of your colleagues .
We shall try to arrange our work better !
This cannot be allowed !
Biocidal products
Mr President , this directive is the missing link in a range of chemical directives .
It is absolutely necessary to be clear about what chemicals are being used in the Union .
It is said that 100 000 different chemicals are on the market .
Only a few have been through an authorization system involving risk assessment , and we see time and again that chemicals can have terrible effects on nature .
Just think of the debate surrounding the declining quality of men 's sperm because chemicals can behave like artificial hormones .
Under the proposal for a directive on biocides , more chemicals will be subject to authorization and that is very positive .
There have been a number of complaints that it will be costly for the manufacturers to have their materials and products approved .
That is true enough .
But it will cost society a lot more in the form of health costs and pollution prevention if we do not achieve better control over the chemicals .
The directive has been a long time coming .
After a long wait the directive is now complete , including Annex 6 .
In addition there is a need for documentation providing technical guidance .
The directive is based on mutual recognition of the products containing biocides , and it may be a problem when not all the Member States have competent authorities within the meaning of the directive .
A weak link in the chain may allow access to the market to easily .
The Environment Committee has therefore opposed automatic market access after 60 days .
It is also important that each national authority has sufficient information before marketing is authorized .
And it is worth noting that the period for data protection in this proposal for a directive is five years longer than that applying to the pesticide directive .
On the last point , all that needs to be said is that we have to start somewhere .
The European Union should set the tone for international assemblies , and it is wealthy enough to pave the way .
On other matters , too , the European Parliament has said that we should not wait for other parts of the world , we should be first ourselves .
The authorization system seems to me to be very flexible and not particularly bureaucratic .
The Environment Committee has been given two different explanations by the Commission as to why there are two Annexes , Nos 3 and 4 , on which to base trials .
Everything is subject to Annex 3 , while Annex 4 should only be used where it is relevant .
For a long time we were given the explanation that it was out of consideration for animals used in experiments .
For example , when toxicological data is already available , and the use of further animals in experiments can be avoided .
But at some point this explanation was altered , so that it was no longer the animals which were to be saved , but the industry .
And this point is really significant .
Parliament would , of course , very much like to save animals from experiments , but we are interested in finding out what the Commission 's interpretation of Annex 4 is .
Will it be possible to avoid Annex 4 simply by referring to economic conditions ?
We cannot have different opinions about the same point .
An important aspect is the alternative assessment of biocides .
It will ensure that the most dangerous substances do not come on to the market or are taken off the market if a less harmful substance is found which can be used for the same purpose .
That is to say that the manufacturers of products containing biocides can always find an active substance , though possibly something different from what they had previously used .
There has , nevertheless , been a political commotion about alternative assessment , a commotion which , in my opinion has grown totally out of proportion .
As a society we should be able to protect ourselves both with products containing biocides but also against the most harmful of the biocides themselves .
An argument against alternative assessment is that it will be to the detriment of small and medium-sized businesses .
It should be remembered that small and medium-sized businesses more often produce products containing biocides rather than the active substances .
Consumers will continue to be able to buy products with which to combat a specific organism , as an active substance is only replaced if a new substance can be used for the same purpose .
It is this very soft and friendly form of alternative assessment which supplements the risk assessment being drafted .
Not a lot to write home about for an environmentally friendly politician , and it is also fully in line with the fifth environment action programme .
Alternative assessment is a new instrument which could well be incorporated into future revision of other chemical directives .
The committee discussed the draft report intensively , and in November 1995 adopted the opinion by an overwhelming majority .
Our opinion seeks to take account of the special features of the biocidal products market .
The total value of this market is estimated at between ECU 1.5 and 2.5 billion .
Somewhat in contrast to the plant protectives sector , this is spread across some 400 active substances and 7000 biocidal products .
Standardizing the authorization procedures among individual countries is a sensible policy , and represents an enormous saving both for the Member States and the producers , and hence their customers .
The market is predominantly structured around SMEs , since the range of different applications for biocidal products makes it possible to cater for individual markets .
Since market volumes are so limited , it needs to be considered how the necessary protection for mankind and the environment can be ensured with minimum financial outlay .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has therefore drawn the following conclusions .
Thirdly , there should be provision for framework formulations for the authorization of active substances which would permit a simple registration procedure for less problematical biocidal products .
This proposal has also largely been adopted by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection .
Fourth , equal treatment of active substances and biocidal products produced in the Community with imported products must be guaranteed .
The rules of the directive must therefore also apply to imports .
Fifth , the fees should reflect costs .
Sixth , the Commission is called upon to submit a detailed study of the economic consequences for small and medium-sized businesses .
The rapporteur mentioned one critical question , that of comparative assessment .
This is a very strong measure to be applied here , and I think we have not heard the last of the debate on this subject .
All in all , the Commission 's proposals will bring about a number of desirable improvements , but will also involve some considerable problems , given the special circumstances of an industry based on SMEs .
I believe that this is a report which displays both faith in the future and purpose .
It is also a report which gives us a tool with which to protect both people 's health and our environment .
I believe that it is important that we establish at Community level a common system for the control of biocidal products . This applies in respect of both the environment and industry .
As a result of the directive companies will in fact have the opportunity and the right conditions to enable them to operate under the same conditions throughout the single market .
By supporting the report Parliament can move towards this goal , which is so decisive for the future .
There are many who were concerned about what the system would mean for small and medium-sized businesses in particular .
This concern focuses above all on the text concerning comparative assessments contained in Article 9 ( 5 ) .
There is anxiety that companies will go out of business and that unemployment will increase .
Our experience in Sweden , however , where we have had this system for almost ten years , suggests the opposite .
We know that the active substances which are produced are produced by large companies which in fact have the capacity to contribute to positive development .
We also know that methods involving comparative assessments have resulted in a broader range of products being available and in more companies coming onto the market .
I also believe that it is important to point out that in our country comparative assessments are conducted in respect of about 10-20 % of the products on the market .
The comparative assessments which have been carried out have been conducted in consultation with both the company and the authorities , and of course consumers .
Though I consider that the report is a good one , I think it is a shame that we have expunged certain parts through compromise , thus weakening it .
This is true above all in respect of antifouling paint for boats , but I am nevertheless in favour of the report .
As has already been pointed out , the proposed directive runs side by side with that already adopted for agricultural pesticides .
The mutual recognition and freedom of movement of biocidal products should therefore be ensured , and nobody should call them into question .
Parliament needs to be given evidence that the scientific and technical requirements which figure in the annexes are of the highest level , in order to ensure that the public feels protected .
If its report had been more specific , things would have been much clearer to a large number of Members who are not familiar with this type of proposal .
Mr President , now for something completely different !
From mad cow disease to biocides - it is certainly a leap both in terms of content and media interest .
The substance of the biocides debate , which nobody by and large understands , is technical down to the smallest detail and totally lacking in ' sexiness ' and , therefore , totally beyond the glare of the media .
Mad cow disease has everything . The mad cows have everything .
But that is the way it is with parliamentary work .
It has thus fallen to me to talk about biocides , which actually have a great deal to do with health .
Because if we do not regulate in this area , then it will be at the expense of people 's health .
The deaths are simply not acknowledged .
There are probably more people who have died from biocides than from mad cows .
But on behalf of the Liberal group I will say that we can support practically all the Environment Committee 's amendments and some of the others .
A reasonable balance has been struck between industry and the environment .
I shall conclude by thanking the rapporteur for the considerable work she has put into this proposal , and recommend its adoption .
Mr President , I believe that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has made considerable improvements to the Commission 's draft directive .
In this respect , I have some reservations on the issuing of licences for ten years , which is a long period .
It does not allow the continuous assessment which would achieve the objectives I have just mentioned .
That is why we have tabled a number of amendments which we hope will improve the present text .
Mr President , I welcome the fact that there is now European legislation on the admissibility of biocidal product for nonagricultural purposes .
That is not an unnecessary luxury on the internal market .
It is only regrettable that it has taken so long to put common principles down on paper .
The document before us , however , forms a satisfactory basis for a uniform admission procedure , in our view .
We are particularly pleased with the so-called alternative evaluation in Article 9 ( 5 ) .
The intention is that the environmentally friendly products will oust the harmful biocides from the market .
That is sad news for the producers of all the old biocides , but if we take sustainable development seriously then the damaging products will have to disappear in due course .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Jensen on her report .
She has put much time and effort into it , as the result bears witness .
Improvements have been suggested on various points , for example on the framework formulation . That should prevent a load of red tape and unnecessary testing .
Another important point is the question of the pesticidal paint .
We have learned in the meantime , as Mr Lannoye has said , that this biocidal paint is very deleterious to the water environment .
You would then be transferring employment to Korea without any noticeable advantage to the environment .
That is why I am in favour of Amendment No 61 which allows an exception for the use of biocides in shipyards .
It is not an elegant solution but I cannot see any other way .
That does not excuse Europe from the obligation to do everything possible to find a solution .
In this context I would ask the Commissioner what the Commission is doing about this .
Is any progress being made in the International Maritime Organisation , and when can we expect something from that organisation ?
Mr President , the ' Europe without frontiers ' needs frontiers .
In the absence of border controls the requirements relating to products coming on the market must be such that products can be safely used in all Member States .
There are many problems involved with the chemical industry , particularly as regards the environment .
Consequently clear legislation is needed to protect both the consumer and the environment .
In her report on biocides , Mrs Kirsten Jensen has addressed the central questions relating to the environment and the consumer .
However , I am not sure that 60 days will be enough in all cases .
In other words , how it will ensure that the environmental impact of products on the market is taken sufficiently into account in differing ecosystems ?
Ladies and gentlemen , the active substances in medicines and plant protection products are covered by the corresponding EU directives .
The last major field remaining - all other active biocidal substances - will now be dealt with by this proposed directive .
These rules are particularly important for the environment and consumer protection , since many people come into contact with products containing biocidal substances .
We are talking here about insecticides , disinfectants , preservatives and products used to protect materials , to mention but a few .
As it stands at present , this new directive will apply to all the groups of biocidal products not covered by the plant protectives directive .
Since it deals with similar effects , the Commission 's draft follows that directive very closely .
Unlike plant protection products , however , biocidal substances are a very diverse sector , as Mr Langen has already pointed out .
There are some 400 active substances used in around 7000 products , and above all produced by many small and medium-sized businesses .
Individual substances and products are already tested on a national basis , and are only licensed for use after testing .
Every test involves not only costs , but also a huge investment of time and materials , with a corresponding administrative burden on the authorities of the Member States .
With these points in mind , our group has tabled a number of amendments .
It is high time that we established European rules on the marketing of these products .
The Commission 's proposal , to my mind , represents a good starting-point for our discussions .
My amendments are focused on the definition and in particular the licensing and placing on the market of products containing biocidal substances .
However , there are more and more Members , and even spokesmen for the Commission , who are using Molitor and its ideas as a cloak for environmental dumping .
That is precisely what we do not want .
Of course , we do not have that impression in the case of this report .
I am very glad to hear that the Commission is letting it be known in the lobbies that it will accept our amendments on framework formulations .
What does this mean ?
It means that in future , products derived from processes which have already been authorized will have a simpler licensing route to follow .
This is a necessary move towards a transparent approach to trade and the environment .
So I am glad , Commissioner , that we have been able to firm up your proposal a little , and it is now well placed to go on for discussion in the Council and its second reading .
Some countries ' environmental conditions differ from those in other countries .
In the northern countries , Finland for example , pest control agents are not needed in anything like the same quantities as in more southerly regions because of the cold climate .
Consequently the regulations in different parts of Europe are different .
It is therefore important that the proposal for a directive currently under discussion should standardize the biocides permitted in the EU countries .
In my opinion products for sale in EU countries but originating from outside the EU should also require this approval , otherwise the directive would damage and distort competition from the point of view of health protection .
The objective of the proposal is quite simple , while the means of achieving it are complicated , and for this reason the proposal is highly technical .
The Commission has acknowledged this situation and we are therefore pleased that the proposal has been clarified by many of the amendments .
A very large number of amendments have been tabled .
Initially 62 and then a further 34 supplementary amendments .
It would take far too long to discuss each individual amendment in detail .
First of all there are the amendments to the recitals .
Amendments Nos 3 , 6 and 92 are acceptable .
Amendment No 2 in principle and Amendment No 5 in part .
Amendments Nos 1 , 4 , 7 and 8 are unacceptable .
Then there are the amendments to the articles .
Amendments Nos 9 , 11 , 17 , 21 , 29 and 31 are acceptable .
Amendment No 20 is also acceptable in part .
Then there are the amendments to Annexes 2 and 3 .
Supplementary Amendments Nos 79-81 and 83 are acceptable , while none of the first Amendments Nos 44-45 are acceptable .
Then there is the amendment of Annex 6 , common principles .
Of these amendments , Nos 56 , 57 and 59 are acceptable .
Amendment No 61 and supplementary Amendment No 64 and 96 are partly acceptable in principle , while Amendments Nos 55 , 58 , 60 and 62 are unacceptable .
I shall now briefly comment on some of the amendments .
With regard to the amendments concerning the articles , I would again like to thank Mrs Kirsten Jensen for Amendment No 31 , which represents a significant improvement to the text .
First 12 , 13 and 15 .
Here I would stress that the proposal for a directive covers the marketing of all products in the Community containing biocides , and that it also includes the conditions of use .
The proposal for a directive does not concern the manufacture of the actual products which contain biocides or treated materials , i.e. materials which are treated with products containing biocides .
Neither does the directive cover products containing biocides which are destined for export outside the Community .
Amendments Nos 42 and 43 , finally , aim to introduce economic means or other measures to restrict the use of products containing biocides .
I can , in general , support these ideas , which are completely in line with the fifth action programme in the environmental sector .
The aim of the proposal is therefore not to draw up an overall strategy for their use .
In this connection I can announce that the Commission has embarked on an investigation into how we might best achieve a viable use of pesticides in the future .
And then there are a number of supplementary amendments which I shall not comment on further , unless I am subsequently requested to do so .
As regards the amendments to Annex 6 , it is the anti-fouling agents in particular which Parliament seem to have been interested in .
I will be pleased to admit - and somewhat different opinions have been voiced in the debate - that the Commission is favourably inclined towards an exemption .
With these remarks I would again thank you for a very positive reception and consideration of the proposal by Parliament .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon .
Price indication
Mr President , although the hour is late I wish to present my report on unit pricing .
And that is also the problem .
There is legislation , but legislation which is too complicated , but at least everyone can agree on the principal .
Mr President , I do not claim to have invented the simple solution .
It was adopted unanimously .
Mr President , what did they want and what do we want ?
We want to put an end to all these complications , we want to stop the endless prolongation of legislation , we want clarity .
And that clarity means trying in principle to indicate the price of the product per unit .
You could no longer see the wood for the trees although I would have happily lived with intelligible series which would also have brought quite a number of environmental advantages .
But that did not happen , Mr President , and that is why we now need this transparent solution .
Now I do appreciate that this transparent solution could bring a few problems in its wake .
I know that full well .
I have written off that problem .
And then Mrs Thyssen and a few others , including Kirsten Jensen , came up with another problem , namely what about the small and medium-sized business .
What has to be done to save the corner shop ?
Mr President , we have presented three solutions for that one .
The shopper can read it off the list .
Mr President , I moved my seat closer to the centre because at this late hour I think we should all huddle together for comfort .
I do not think this has been the most distinguished evening in the history of Parliament .
Maybe now we are discussing something which is not so much a Columbus egg as a Columbus omelette .
We are , at this moment , at this very late hour , trying to decide the strengths and weaknesses of the directive .
I want to congratulate the rapporteur - once again - for coming forward with a measure which has significant benefits for consumers in the European Union .
I echo her words of praise for the Economic and Social Committee , from whom I have learnt a great deal in the course of our discussions .
I want to confine myself to speaking about some of the reservations that were raised then which I hope to put to the Commission .
There is a good deal of uncertainty about a number of things : the cost of the equipment , which the small trader will need .
Some will go for a list , some may use a price-gun , some may want some computerized system .
That is compounded by the multiplicity of prices that will have to be displayed as this period overlaps that in which we shall be moving towards the single currency .
Finally , there is a difficulty because the price estimates that have been produced by the Commission thus far are somewhat at variance with the estimates we have from the retailers themselves .
That is not surprising . They will sometimes exaggerate and sometimes the Commission may underestimate .
But there are differences and we believe that there should be a continuing review of precisely what the price implications will be .
One of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten 's amendments deals with the question of information for the small retailer .
I hope some amendments which have come from our side of the committee will give further reassurance in this matter .
I personally can see no reason why , in that time , the main problems for small traders cannot be met .
She has indicated general assent with most of these exclusions .
Mr President , the two-fold pricing that the Commission is proposing is undoubtedly a help for shoppers who want to compare prices .
To that extent the proposal for a directive is to be welcomed .
Some amendments , Mr President , offer a glimmer of comfort , but apart from Amendment No 5 they are all theoretical .
Even Amendments Nos 7 and 9 fail to convince me .
They do not need information so much as less paperwork .
Mr President , my second objection is to the timing .
I fail to understand why this proposal cannot wait until the Euro has been introduced as the sole legal tender , to July 2002 .
Amendment No 18 confers on Member States the opportunity , not the obligation , to permit small businesses a postponement , thanks to our colleague , Mr Whitehead , but why not postpone the whole thing ?
Mr President , I shall speak briefly only for long enough to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , for dealing in such a complete and well-informed manner with a matter which is technically not of the simplest .
I think the extra time for technological adaptation is enough .
Still , we would ask the Commission to make a further effort to accept the amendments presented today , which are those left over from the last draft , voted on Monday evening .
Thus I think we shall have a directive appreciated both by traders and consumers - and that is not a trifle !
Mr President , I wish to congratulate my colleague , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , on her flexible approach as rapporteur to the subject .
We are used to a different technique from her , especially on drugs , but in this case she has been very flexible .
The Group of the European Liberal and Democratic Party welcomes the present directive to replace two old directives for the last two just did not work in practice .
Some colleagues and even the Agriculture Committee have tried to re-instate the old system .
We reject their attempts to do so , as they have proved not to work .
My question is : when will the Commission , when will Commissioner Bonino , produce the statement on the financial consequences of this system for the retail trade ?
That makes it much simpler and I am looking at Mrs Thyssen .
Let us make the new system of pricing , which I support , as easy as possible for retailers to apply .
Mr President , some supermarkets already indicate prices per unit .
It does not cost the shop keeper any extra money but it helps the consumer .
That is why I welcome binding European legislation on pricing .
We can happily assume this will be welcomed by consumer organisations .
I wish to pay tribute to the work of the rapporteur , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten .
With her amendments she has improved considerably a number of points of the Commission 's proposal .
They may seem trivialities , but this legislation has tremendous repercussions for innumerable shop keepers and consumers .
That is why it is important to word things carefully and define retailers ' obligations .
I think a good balance has been struck for the position of the small business .
I understand that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is confident that her report will be passed in the final vote .
Perhaps the Commission 's opinion on the amendments may yet cause her a sleepless night .
Be that as it may , I do wish her a good night 's sleep .
She has earned it and to look at her she needs it , and she is not the only one .
The point has already been made that the directive allows retailers a period of grace , without in any way affecting the protection given to the consumer .
Anyone wishing to breathe life into the section of the EU Treaty which refers to a high level of consumer protection must , to my mind , be in favour of this report .
For many products , they cannot see the unit price at a glance .
Price transparency does not exist - but that was the aim at European level nearly 20 years ago .
The rules which have applied up to now have no doubt made things better for the consumer in some countries .
Personally - and here I am in the same boat as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten - I have found them rather confusing , and quite often simply a puzzle .
If I bought an unwrapped piece of ham , I could see the selling price and the cost per kilo .
If I bought a prepacked item , I could see that there were two pieces , but had no idea how big they were : it would just say 116 grams and the selling price .
I had to work out for myself what the cost per pound or kilo was .
So I am very pleased , no doubt like the great majority of consumers , to see the unit price at last becoming a reality .
It is true , as the rapporteur has explained , that she has tried in various amendments to lighten the burden on small shops .
In her Amendment No 14 we read of the possibility of putting up price lists and placards inside shops .
Well , Mr President , you come from Italy .
I ask you , think of those small Italian shops that you know in Italian towns , piled high from floor to ceiling with goods , hundreds of different items .
I do not myself think that it will be possible in small shops with that huge variety of items packed close in to have unit pricing indicated simply by putting up posters at one end of the shops .
So that would mean that it would be much easier if you went over to a computerized system of pricing .
The net result of this directive , unless the burden on small shops is lightened , will be that small shops either narrow the range of their products or else they go out of business .
I must explain that I believe that Amendment No 7 is not possible for the Commission to accept .
It would set a tremendous precedent to invent Commission support to help pay for the price of the directive .
They cannot all be wrong !
This directive creates real problems for small shops and I hope the Commission will address it .
Thank you to the rapporteur , thank you to the Members who have followed this debate .
I should like to take the cue from come observations made by Mrs Jackson and make one or two clarifications .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is not inventing a directive .
One year is really too short a time to manage to draw up a coherent report .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at noon tomorrow .
( The sitting was closed at 12.35 a.m. )
Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Mr President , in yesterday 's Minutes it is recorded that I abstained on Amendment No 22 on the Oostlander report .
It was my intention to vote for it .
It was a case of mea culpa rather than a faulty machine .
Please , could it be corrected .
It will be corrected .
Mr President , yesterday I managed to reach the Chamber just as the Minutes were being agreed - I had been attending another meeting .
Had I been here , I would have made a correction .
Yesterday 's Minutes said that we agreed Tuesday 's Minutes but in fact Tuesday 's Minutes were incorrect .
They omitted the reference to my presentation of the discharge report on the general budget and the FED .
It was a 13-minute speech .
I may not be the world 's greatest speaker but 13 minutes is quite a sizeable chunk to miss .
I should be grateful if that could be corrected in Tuesday 's Minutes .
We take note of that .
( Parliament approved the Minutes )
Monetary cooperation
Secondly , I should like to stress the fact that I believe that I have drawn up a consensus report .
In twelve years , the value of transactions per day has multiplied by a factor of twenty .
The international capital market enables countries with little capacity to generate domestic savings to gain immediate access to external savings - often on exceptionally favourable financial terms .
This allows such countries to finance economic development policies which they would otherwise be unable to fund .
Finally , we are calling for the essential cooperation between the Governors of the Central Banks to be carried out under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements .
Mr President , this report on the strengthening of world monetary cooperation to ensure better regulation of monetary and financial markets is very timely .
After all , we in Europe recognize only too well that activity one side of the world can have profound effects elsewhere , including Europe .
If that is true in the Europe of today , imagine the situation once the Euro has entered the currency markets .
What are we to do in this new environment which will be upon us shortly ?
We will need strong international cooperation , and the newly-fledged European Central Bank will need to quickly master its global , as well as its local , role .
Although the Garriga Polledo report perhaps underplays the degree of danger unleashed by liberalizing the financial markets , I believe we can support the remedies suggested by the rapporteur .
Nor should we fail to remind the financial community of their own responsibilities .
The better they can regulate and monitor themselves , the better we , the politicians , will be satisfied .
The sorry story of Barings ' collapse reveals all too palpably human frailty at work .
Whatever else is true , it is apparent that the internal checks and balances were not operating successfully between London and Singapore .
That brings me back to where I started .
We truly live now in an interdependent world and must reform ourselves to meet these new circumstances .
This would be implemented by the use of an early-warning system , relying on the appropriate financing mechanisms and promoting the strengthening of international cooperation .
The operative part of the motion for a resolution contained in Mr Garriga Polledo 's report , the broad lines of which we support , prompts two comments from us .
We therefore need to keep out heads and not put pressure either on the course of events or on the States .
Mr President , the rapporteur seems to be relying too much on the assumption that the movement of capital functions best under the current international funding systems .
Nor am I sure about the Social Democrats ' proposal that it would be sufficient to set up an international economic council to monitor speculation .
There is a need for a much more radical change to worldwide funding structures .
At present the sum of money changing hands throughout the world is equivalent to three times the foreign currency reserves of many industrialized countries .
Neither any national banks nor their international counterparts are capable of combating this level of speculation .
Of course the Greens too support the establishment of this type of early warning system and the strengthening of cooperation on international financial policy .
This , indeed , was proposed last year at the Halifax Summit and this is what the rapporteur is now proposing , but it is really not enough .
There is a need for measures which will automatically prevent speculation , and the speculators must be made to pay for such measures .
The proposal which is urgently needed is to bring into force an international tax on speculation capital .
This was proposed as long ago as 1978 by James Tobin , who later won the Nobel Prize .
Even a very low tax , of the order of 0.5 % on the quantity of capital exchanged could have a significant effect on reducing particularly short-term placements or speculation proper .
Whatever one may think about the Bretton Woods agreements , the superiority of the dollar as a reference currency for the entire international monetary system was justified on three grounds .
One was political : the United States had just won , and helped the Europeans to win , the Second World War .
That was an important reason , but it was one born of circumstances , and has now become invalid .
The second reason was economic : the United States were financing European reconstruction through the Marshall Plan .
Here again , they seem to me to be its main beneficiaries , but this reason too has ceased to exist .
The United States abandoned that guarantee on 15 August 1971 .
We even experienced American treasury officials touring Europe and saying to the European leaders : ' The dollar is our currency and this is your problem . '
I think , therefore , that we should think carefully .
After all , as has just been said , a universal capital taxation mechanism serves a speculative purpose .
We also need to consider what , today , is the justification of credit , and especially short-term credit , and we need to consider a new monetary agreement .
Mr President , the Garriga Polledo report supplies an excellent analysis of the international money markets and their possibilities with regard to regulation , but it also contains a considerable surprise .
It hardly mentions the supposed stabilizing virtues of the single currency at world level .
Yet the Commission 's arguments always include , prominently faced , a paragraph from which we learn that ' the single currency will contribute to greater worldwide monetary stability ' .
It is hard to understand exactly what this statement is supposed to mean , and the Garriga Polledo report provides no enlightenment .
The explanatory statement , in fact , contains not a single word on the subject , while the motion for a resolution itself contains one brief reference , which is expressed as a hope rather than an argument .
In order to achieve that objective , there is no real need for the crutch of the single currency - all that is needed is courage and discipline .
On the other hand , the report does in fact disclose a disadvantage of monetary union .
By abolishing exchange rates within the Euro zone , it will cause the disappearance of an indicator and the yardstick for the quality of national administration .
However , it may unfortunately occur that currencies are lastingly undervalued or overvalued relative to the real parities of purchasing power .
In this case , international monetary cooperation should be a possibility , in order to bring the exchange rate back within an acceptable band , and it could be coordinated by the IMF , as the report rightly indicates .
In these circumstances , once again , we deplore the fact that countries which are the victims of monetary dumping cannot , ultimately , protect themselves by means of compensatory monetary sums .
Whether this dumping is the result of the deliberate intent of a third party or of the mechanical interplay of market forces at a given moment makes no difference .
The compensatory sums would reestablish their competition and even the possibility of their implementation would surely be sufficient to produce a substantial deterrent effect .
We regret the fact that the latest GATT negotiations do not include a monetary section , and we hope , Mr President , that further discussions on this subject will begin as soon as possible .
Mr President , I too am grateful to the rapporteur for this very well presented and very effective report .
It also states that a free capital market ensures that savings are assigned to the most productive investments .
This highlights the need for Europe to act .
The second call , to curb the predominance of the US dollar , is without doubt justified , and the single currency might be of assistance here .
It is also important to bear in mind external debt and the developing countries .
I do not think there is any point , in this context , in writing off financial positions as debts which will never be repaid .
Overall , therefore , I think the report is a constructive one : it provides a good starting-point for further discussion in the various European forums .
Mr President , this report is a most timely one , in that immediately prior to the April meeting of the IMF and the World Bank , it once again calls for an improvement in international monetary cooperation .
It can thus be said that a new Bretton Woods system is even more urgently needed now than was the case when it was originally introduced .
Because after all , as the report makes clear , the US dollar accounts for 60 % of world currency reserves , which in no way corresponds to the importance of the US economy .
The European Parliament has already quite rightly called on the Commission several times to produce a white paper on monetary developments .
Today we are going further , and also asking for an assessment of the effects of monetary union on the stability of the international financial system .
I therefore believe that we are quite right to call on the Commission to carry out further studies in this area .
What is most important of all , however , is to establish a UN Economic Council along the lines of the UN Security Council , in order to institutionalize monetary cooperation .
Mr President , in my opinion Parliament acted responsibly when it gave the Committee on Economic Affairs the opportunity to draw up this report .
The economic cooperation which has developed has benefited nations and their citizens .
The exchange of raw materials and product information has fostered development .
The use of energy provides a good analogy for this process .
Skill in exploiting energy , consumption of and trade in raw materials have benefitted us to a great extent .
Only the excessive use of energy and its various forms are causing us problems .
In the same way we may say that the liberalization of capital is positive in itself ; however , the enlargement of foreign exchange markets has assumed ungovernable proportions .
Common sense dictates that a change must be made .
It is also clear that the European single currency would facilitate the necessary cooperation with Japan and the United States on setting rules for the currency markets .
There is frequent talk of the confidence of the citizen .
This is also an essential condition for all democracy and market economy .
Therefore the world democratic governments must bring the currency markets under control .
There is no time to waste ; regulation is needed above all to protect ordinary citizens and their jobs .
Their work depends on the real economy , not on speculation .
Small businesses in small countries suffer especially from uncertain currency markets .
They do not have the resources or the opportunity to protect themselves .
Small countries also have to increase their currency reserves many times over compared to large countries .
EMU would in these circumstances be a healthy development .
It would reduce the need for these reserves and yet at the same time could increase creditability .
It is quite true that the regulation and taxation of capital movements need to be harmonised .
If the movement of capital is free , such taxation should be made compulsory .
Capital cannot be given a free ride . It must bear the social responsibility of paying tax .
But if progress is to be made in this matter we must also support the Single European Currency .
Only in this way will it be possible to move forward in this area .
Mr President , I start by congratulating Mr Garriga Polledo on the very comprehensive and technical report before us today .
The international financial markets now play a very important role in the world economy .
The deregulation of financial markets in many member countries has meant that trillions of pounds and dollars can now flow across international borders to seek a return for those investors .
It is clear that what we need is sustainable positions across the globe whether it is in the United States , Europe , Japan or indeed in the developing world .
I also accept some of the analysis of Mr Garriga Polledo in terms of the fact that the international monetary system needs rules .
I echo the words of Mr Rönnholm on that .
In order to create those rules it needs an institutional framework .
At the moment , as we see in Europe , the Bundesbank acts in the interest of the German economy .
We are trying to create a system where we would have a European Central Bank acting in the interests of the European economy .
We see a similar position with the US , the Japanese and the European markets acting to some extent on their own .
What we need is a system which acts in terms of the global interest and international objectives .
The only way we can do that is through rules and through international cooperation .
I also accept some of the assertions by Mr Garriga Polledo about the damage that floating exchange rates can do .
It can cause over-evaluation of currencies .
I believe that the money markets are not necessarily the best judge of real economic performance , as we have seen with the exchange rate mechanism here in Europe .
I do not necessarily believe either that intervention is the answer .
What we need is a new direction .
That new direction is cooperation .
We need a framework which will be brought into existence after stage three of monetary union .
I do not necessarily believe , as the rapporteur suggests , that the IMF and the World Bank are the best institutions to do that .
But I agree that the G7 is not enough .
What we need is to include the fast-growing economies of Asia in that process and , at the same time , look at how we can involve the developing world in that process .
We need new multilateral procedures , we need cooperation because the success of the global economy and the livelihoods of many people around the world depend on it .
Mr President , at national level we accept that markets cannot function without rules imposed by national government .
Whilst national markets still functioned primarily on a national scale this worked well enough .
With the advent of the European Single Market the ability of national governments to continue imposing their own rules on markets was weakened .
Much of the internal market programme was then targeted at reproducing at European level this ability of national governments to set the rules .
On one level , however , the Member States were negligent .
When capital movements were liberalized the advice of the European Parliament that instruments should be set up at European level to counter any undesired developments was ignored .
With the globalization of capital movements , resulting from the predominance of liberal thinking and technological innovation , a worldwide capital market came into being which knows no rules but its own .
In normal circumstances this seems to work reasonably well .
But when these markets fall prey to speculation , there are manifestly no checks on the system .
The tidal waves then unleashed do great damage to the economy , but governments collectively and the central banks have no power to do anything about it .
The question is , should the political and nonfinancial business world resign itself to this and regard waves of speculation as merely a natural phenomenon , or not ?
However tricky a tax of this kind might be , its introduction depends primarily on whether or not the necessary political will is there .
Pious aspirations about reducing labour costs by taxing less can be realized in this way .
It will certainly be easier than putting a man on the moon and far more useful .
The same cannot be said about the subject of his report , the international financial markets .
The rationale of the markets has almost gone too far .
A few weeks ago , Wall Street started to fall , not because unemployment in the United States increased but because it fell .
Think what would happen to us if unemployment began to fall in Europe !
Fortunately , our conservative governments , with their employment policies , protect us from any such ill-omened development !
They have created the Third World debt disaster .
The deregulated money markets created the SLM scandal in the United States , a scandal involving hundreds of billions of dollars that taxpayers had to pay for .
Similarly , a year ago they created the Mexico crisis even though Mexico implemented all the rules they had dictated to it .
And here , European taxpayers have also had to pay their costs .
Mr President , in today 's political conditions the major conservative governments refuse to cooperate on monetary issues .
Mr President , the Commission welcomes Mr Garriga Polledo 's report , which recommends greater international monetary and financial cooperation .
This report has been perfectly timed to support the Commission in its efforts to improve international monetary cooperation .
In the Commission 's view , and as emphasized by the rapporteur , a stable national economic policy remains a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the stability of the international monetary system .
Moreover , while the markets serve a useful purpose in imposing discipline , they can have destabilizing effects which need to be offset by international cooperation .
In the short term , this is above all a matter of improved monitoring and the creation of crisis prevention mechanisms .
In the longer term , institutional reforms are needed to make it easier to step up international cooperation and enhance the coordination of macroeconomic policy .
The Commission is therefore in favour of increased cooperation between the international institutions .
One of the major challenges for international cooperation in the future will be to take more account of the interdependence not only between countries , but also between their policies .
The Commission is willing to assume this role .
The question of international cooperation in the monetary arena must also be considered in the light of monetary union , which will have far-reaching consequences for the international monetary system .
It should be stressed here that the introduction of economic and monetary union should considerably improve international monetary cooperation .
In this way , the Union would also be in a better position to coordinate monetary policy with its international partners and to bring about a reform of the international monetary system .
To achieve this , however , the European Union must adopt a firm and steadfast attitude towards its partners .
It also remains to be decided how the monetary union could and should be represented in the international institutions .
Until such time as a new framework for international monetary and financial coordination has been defined , however , it would seem premature to comment on a financial support mechanism to minimize exchange-rate fluctuations .
Finally , as far as financial monitoring is concerned , the Commission will continue to carry out its existing responsibilities .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12.00 .
Economic and Monetary Union
The next item is the report ( A4-0073 / 96 ) by Mr Walter , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , on Economic and Monetary Union and economic and social cohesion .
And yet , if the nations of Europe are to continue to coexist in peace , they must be guided by more ambitious goals .
This includes bringing the EU Member States closer together in terms of living standards and opportunities in the various regions .
It will also help to improve the effectiveness of the Structural Funds , the Union 's most important instrument of economic and social cohesion .
It is therefore necessary to draw up a cohesion strategy laying down specific stages , as happened in the case of economic and monetary union .
In practice , this means that once EMU is up and running , we must first do our utmost to ensure that its foundations are stable and lasting .
This will require both the participating countries and the pre-in countries to act responsibly .
Secondly , however , we shall need to be supportive of those who are pressing on steadfastly with their sometimes difficult task of meeting the criteria .
This could perhaps be done by means of an extended instrument of solidarity like the new Cohesion Fund .
We are definitely not thinking here of financial compensation : an equal measure of solidarity must be shown by the ins and the outs .
We should consider using less rigid indicators than GDP , as at present : unemployment statistics should be included .
Key factors are sustainable growth , changes in economic trends , action to prevent exclusion , and the state of infrastructure , including social and cultural infrastructure .
These indicators should also be used in developing and focusing the Union 's most important instrument of cohesion , the Structural Funds , and the challenges which lie ahead of them .
We should also have the courage to set deadlines by which tangible progress is to be made .
The self-confidence shown when EMU was introduced must not be dismissed as unattainable in the case of cohesion .
In a European Union with 17 million unemployed , employment policy must take top priority .
We are therefore calling for an explicit article on employment to be incorporated into the Maastricht Treaty .
Europe will have a bright future if it can combine solidarity with reliability .
Policies to create economic and social cohesion will be the litmus test of a peaceful and united Europe .
On the other hand , such short- and medium-term considerations may well have to take account of distortions or even disruptions of the internal market .
It has to be said , however , that adverse effects on employment certainly do not occur in one direction only .
We experienced this in Austria when , in 1995 , our Italian neighbours devalued the lira .
It was not the case that adverse effects on employment were immediately felt in Italy - far from it .
Austria , a country with a hard currency , was the one to suffer , when millions of schillings ' worth of purchasing power poured into Italy from Austria .
All I am saying is that there is no one-way street here and no automatic response , but that the effects are of many kinds and must all be taken into account .
None of this goes far enough .
And thirdly , private investment must be stimulated , since this alone can create truly secure jobs .
People in our industrial , declining , peripheral and rural regions need to know that EMU will have some benefit for them .
In this report my group has pledged its support for EMU .
EMU therefore needs to demonstrate that it can support , underpin and promote cohesion .
I wish to emphasize again what Mr Walter has put into his report .
It is a very relevant debate .
President Lamfalussy of the EMI spoke to Parliament 's Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs on Monday and presented the annual report .
The word ' cohesion ' did not pass his lips once .
It is disappointing that these issues are not dealt with as a whole and cohesive strategy .
Looking at the countries that will join EMU from the beginning , it appears that the countries on the outside may suffer punitive actions .
Finally , we need to step up our actions in the regions .
We need to reaffirm what was agreed at the European Council in Madrid .
This is why we need an active cohesion policy orientated towards employment and growth .
Nominal and real convergence are not two mutually contradictory goals here .
Sound public finances , stable prices , low interest rates and a stable exchange rate are preconditions for growth and employment .
EMU , with all its advantages - including in particular for social and economic cohesion - is impossible without nominal convergence .
It is therefore clear that a reduction in crippling national debt plays an important role with regard to investment , and thus employment .
Practical experience in recent years has shown that where unemployment has been tackled by increasing national debt and raising taxes , no lasting success has been achieved .
One of the main challenges at the start of EMU will therefore be to define the relationship between the currencies of participating states and those of countries which are not participating .
The Walter report explores this problem .
The many amendments tabled by my group have , in my view , brought about some good compromises , even though not all our hopes have been fulfilled .
Let me therefore draw particular attention to two points which are of considerable importance to my group .
Furthermore , we cannot agree to an economic steering body as a counterpart of the ECB .
We cannot and do not wish to alter the Treaty ; otherwise , competition would ultimately be eliminated and the market partially segmented , to the detriment of consumers .
Surely that cannot be in our interest .
I would therefore ask the House to vote in favour of our amendment on this specific point .
We must bear in mind that this principle should not be limited to the structural funds but should be applied to all the measures taken by the European Union and also to Economic and Monetary Union .
That is the only reason why it was given so much emphasis in the Treaties .
In my opinion , a positive implication .
We have discussed both of these issues many times separately .
Economic and social cohesion , on the one hand , and economic and monetary union , on the other . But we have to see them as interlinked .
We must reconcile the attempt at achieving economic and social cohesion with achievement of economic and monetary union .
That is what we have to do and that is what is imposed upon us by the Treaty on European Union .
The Walter report shows us that this aim is not easy but nor is it impossible .
Moreover , if we fail to bring about this reconciliation the effects for the European Union will be disastrous .
Cohesion and degradation of the environment are equally incompatible .
The Confederal Group of the European United Left wishes to express its concern at the dangers to cohesion which economic and monetary union involves .
The present convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty are neither compatible with the principle of cohesion , nor sufficient .
Others must be considered : convergence in terms of unit labour costs , the wage-productivity ratio , and so on .
Otherwise - and this is a serious point - the adjustments will be made , and they are already being made , at the cost of jobs .
Because , as Mr Walter points out in his report , the conclusions of the Madrid summit and other initiatives may remain empty words if they are not genuinely put into effect .
Unfortunately , it is not consistent .
The effects on regional development make the downside of the planned monetary union all too clear .
Our role in Parliament is in fact to take corrective action , but Parliament too is starting to question the original principle of economic and social cohesion .
I indicated during yesterday 's debate on enlargement to the east that the European Union is in urgent need of reform .
Social and ecological reform would provide an excellent opportunity to bring the economic crisis under control .
I believe that three points should be borne in mind when it comes to meeting the criteria on government debt and net deficits .
Firstly , the Member States should realize - or be reminded - that the only way to achieve this objective is by means of a judicious savings programme .
Thirdly , and quite simply , there must be a guarantee that this single currency will not be imposed against the wishes of the citizens of Europe .
Economic and social cohesion has always been a Community goal , but as Mr Walter points out , the Treaties do not provide us with a clear definition of this concept .
The report raises another issue to which I should like to refer : the impact of future accessions on Community regional policy .
Mr Walter is quite blunt on this point : the future enlargement must , under no circumstances , be carried out to the detriment of the cohesion countries .
We listened to the views of many authorities in a public hearing and , finally , we adopted almost unanimously the initial report drawn up by Mr Walter .
As an indication of this unanimity , almost all the speeches that we have heard today have agreed on the fundamental issues .
Article 2 of the Treaty clearly stipulates that the establishment of a single market and an economic and monetary union must serve to promote economic and social cohesion .
It could not be any other way , and the founding texts and the numerous articles which have enlarged upon them over the years repeatedly refer to this question .
I would point out , incidentally , that the Commission unfortunately failed to make any reference to this subject in its report .
So the establishment of economic and monetary union and a single currency is an objective if not of all , then of a broad majority of the Members of this Parliament .
Today , we are fully aware of the social costs of convergence .
On the other hand , however , we have heard no clear explanation of the measures that must be taken to offset those costs .
This not a simple challenge , and meeting it will be fraught with difficulties : but no one said that building Europe would be easy .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Walter 's report is an important one .
I myself am a member of the Committee on Regional Policy and of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in which the report was discussed .
The proposals it contains to counter social dumping and strengthen regional policy and employment policy in order to counterbalance EMU are of course good ones .
Here , however , I represent opinion in the Nordic countries which is critical of EMU , Mr President .
I myself am against EMU - my group holds a different view .
The reason for my critical attitude is that the risks are too great .
EMU is a high-risk project , as the Walter report makes clear .
Sweden and the Nordic countries are vast areas and already have serious regional problems .
We are afraid that these problems will become considerably worse if EMU is implemented .
Such studies on the effects of EMU on these areas , both in the long and the short term , should be conducted before EMU is implemented .
For example , what will change for the Member States when they become part of EMU - if they do so ?
What instruments of control will remain at national level to deal with economic slumps , for example ?
Sudden changes in , for instance , the timber industry as a result of lower prices would soon turn into a crisis in Sweden and Finland .
Will countries still be able , at national level , to pursue certain economic policies , interest and exchange rate policies , regional and labour market policies , and so on ?
I doubt it !
It would also be best if the EMU project - if it is implemented according to the current timetable - contained a description of the decision-making process .
The present report should be seen as an initial step towards elucidating the consequences of EMU .
This approach is illusory .
Mr Walter 's report falls foul of a substantial obstacle which he cannot overcome : the incompatibility of the single currency with economic and social cohesion .
Furthermore , the European Social Observatory has recently acknowledged that the Economic and Monetary Union model inevitably carries the seeds of social deregulation .
The former Chairman of the Bundesbank , Mr Otto Pöhl , for his part recently stated that compliance with the convergence criteria was incompatible with the desire to combat unemployment .
The social unrest in France during November and December opened the way to the financial markets by expressing the workforce 's rejection of a social model based on ultra-liberalism .
This debate is a series of isolated statements without any real dialogue or thought .
But the Walter report is a noteworthy report of enormous lucidity and I am entirely in agreement with it .
A single currency will represent one of the most profound changes which Europe has undergone in recent decades .
There will be a ' before and after ' in terms of the single currency .
A new ball game . And the challenge to the poorer regions posed , in the field of the single currency , an extremely powerful challenge .
The single currency is going to be an important element of the identification of European citizens with the European Union .
Early on , the Union will have to set up a federal-type budget .
The current budget will be insufficient , too limited and restricted in terms of the implications of economic and monetary union .
That is why territorial cohesion calls for the continuation of structural policies and this itself calls for a stepping up , rather than a closing down , of structural policies .
We must do it because nominal convergence is to a large extent a prerequisite for true convergence .
By improving the health of the weaker economies we help them in the long term to approach the stronger ones .
However , the criteria for achieving nominal convergence , however important they may be , are not enough for the achievement of true convergence .
Mr President , there is a risk associated with enlargement , concerning which we all of course agree in principle .
We need not only a Europe institutionally equipped for enlargement , but at the same time a Europe ready to deal with the economic issues raised by enlargement itself .
It is therefore a matter of absolute priority to implement an integrated regional policy , with all the improvements demanded to make it more effective .
Such a situation is politically unacceptable and economically destructive , especially for countries like my own , Greece , which are advancing at the lower speed .
Yet , the picture of negative consequences is still incomplete .
Might it be that the Commission and the European Parliament too should begin working on such a study ?
Mr President , I want to thank Mr Walter for his report .
It contains a lot of ideas and useful proposals .
I think it is a good comment on regional policy and its importance within the European Union .
Economic and social cohesion is what we are trying to achieve with regional policy .
Regional policy is something we will need always .
By comparison with resources in the United States of America they are quite small .
We know from historical experience that economic activity ebbs and flows and what is rich today may be poor in 50 years from now .
If we are going to have a European Union then a strong , important regional policy will be a very important component of the policies that we pursue at European level .
In the case of Ireland I think the figure is a little bit out .
Experience has shown that the internal market has helped the poorer and peripheral states to grow .
Our colleagues from Greece would have to explain to us why it is the exception .
Sicily also is an exception , but there is a problem there .
For the future , the sacred cow of additionality will have to be revised under new programmes .
It only complicates the whole issue .
We are saying in the structural funds that we must have additionality .
That means that most of the Member States - the poor states - will increase spending .
But as far as monetary union is concerned we are saying that they must reduce spending .
When we have a new programme we will have to look at the economic planning of the less prosperous states .
There has to be a partnership between them and the Commission .
We have to sit down and work out sensible economic plans and apply to their policies the resources that we can afford .
But the element of additionality cannot be proven in such small amounts of money spread over so many policies .
It is only wasting the time of Commission officials and obstructing the whole business of trying to evaluate what has been achieved .
Mr President , I should like to begin my speech with the warm congratulations deserved by a well-drafted report such as that presented by Mr Walter .
I would also make an initial remark comparing one aspect of our situation with that of the United States .
Per capita income in the richest region in the United States , Connecticut , is twice as high as that in the poorest , Mississippi .
Per capita income in Thuringia , the poorest region in the European Union , is one sixth of that in Hamburg .
Perhaps it is realities such as these , amongst other things , which ensure that economic and social cohesion is not an incidental goal of the European Union , but an objective which is enshrined in the Treaties .
The European Parliament is calling on the Intergovernmental Conference to promote and defend economic and social cohesion as a key element of the European Union .
And we must state quite clearly that we fear that economic and monetary union may have a serious negative impact on cohesion , if the necessary accompanying measures are not taken .
I do not intend to examine the statistical details of convergence .
Let me simply point out that at the present time , the only three countries which would fulfil the convergence criteria are Argentina , Taiwan and Singapore .
I should like to know how many interpretations of the Maastricht Treaty will be made if France or Germany fail to fulfil the criteria .
No country which has made a genuine effort to fulfil the convergence criteria should be excluded from the single currency .
That is my personal position .
Mr President , I also welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur .
As we know , the reduction of regional disparities is one of the fundamental aims of the EU .
In fact Ireland insisted on Article 130b being inserted into the Maastricht Treaty .
The Irish economy is a very open economy and very dependent on foreign trade .
We could see that recently with regard to the beef crisis , which showed the effect on our exports and how dependent we are .
I believe the EMU will be of particular benefit to Ireland and other peripheral regions .
There has to be a balanced relationship between EMU and cohesion .
The structural funds after the year 2000 should be qualitatively and quantitatively strengthened in their third stage .
A balance must be struck between the continuing needs of the present Member States and the demands of the new Members that will join us after the next phase of enlargement .
This is one crucial message contained in your motion for a resolution to which I fully subscribe .
The single European currency and the completion of the European single market are needed to ensure our competitiveness , but they must be supplemented by the European Union 's third priority : economic and social cohesion .
The convergence criteria , which have been the subject of sometimes heated public debate , not only correspond to a sound economic policy , but are also necessary for cohesion .
Generally speaking , it is the weakest Member States which suffer from having to pay a risk premium on interest rates .
Real convergence requires an active national and European policy to promote growth in the poorer regions .
Experience over the past two decades has shown that in the long term , devaluation does not improve the competitiveness of European countries .
Further thought must also be devoted in this context to an extension of the Cohesion Fund for the purposes of achieving the convergence criteria .
We also share your opinion about the link between environmental and regional policy .
This does not rule out competition either within the public service or between the public and private sectors ; nor would it exclude public-private partnerships .
I think in fact that we all agree on this point .
In my view , if economic and social cohesion is to be increased , living standards in the Union must be aligned and overall economic development brought into balance .
This means more than fulfilling the convergence criteria .
It includes the creation of jobs , especially in structurally weak regions and for problem groups within the workforce ; it includes sustainable development in disadvantaged regions .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at noon .
1994 Cohesion Fund
As for the report being debated , I should like to emphasise four of the aspects dealt with in it .
Secondly , I should like to point out that it is obviously insufficient that , in the period under our analysis , only one supervisory committee has met .
This can be seen as a symptom of the weak dynamics of this machinery - a vital machinery for monitoring the Fund 's activity .
Such an approach can only increase the effectiveness of the use of Cohesion Fund appropriations .
It should be recalled that , in this Article , there is a conditionality on financing of the actions by this Fund on observance of the nominal convergence criteria defined in view of economic and monetary union .
This means , of course , that we must pay very close attention to this application .
We will then be able to monitor this part too of the execution of the Cohesion Fund .
Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Costa Neves on his report .
Its declared aim is therefore to support economic and social cohesion .
It also leads to a vicious circle since the withholding of credits then leads to worse recession , which entails additional non-productive expenditure , which in turn exacerbates the financial problem .
The debate on this item will be resumed today at 6 p.m .
A group of terrorists attacked innocent tourists with the loss of 17 or 18 lives , most of them Greek tourists , and 14 or 15 wounded , 7 of whom are in a critical condition .
I would also like to express the sentiments of us all , I presume , in addressing Parliament 's warmest condolences to the families of those who died , and our sympathy towards the families of those wounded .
Mr President , you have spoken for us all .
I too heard a little while ago about what has happened , from Mr Dimitrakopoulos .
I do not know whether that would be part of a travel directive or something else , but I believe the European Union could contribute in some way towards the protection of citizens .
Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to express our revulsion and sorrow at this terrorist act , and our sympathy for the families of the victims .
Mr President , I too , on behalf of our political group , would like to express our sharing of this grief and to ask that we should not dignify such occurrences with a political or any other character .
Terrorism is to be condemned anywhere in the world , and that is all .
Mr President , on a very serious point of order .
I shall be very brief .
I have discovered that , although we protested to the President in the chair , he used the speakers ' list that was given to him by the other political groups .
I find it unacceptable that out of 14 speakers , 11 were on the speakers ' list .
There were at least 70 people in the Chamber .
I find that unacceptable in terms of the democratic accountability of this House .
Votes
Mr President , is it acceptable , now that we have voted on nearly a hundred amendments , that the plenary should substitute its own text for that of the committee responsible ?
Mr Pasty , I think this is an issue that should be considered both by the Conference of Presidents of the Political Groups and by the Bureau .
I would not like to start a debate here , in Plenary .
It is one of Parliament 's eternal problems and we have tried very many times to solve it without any result so far .
Let our Presidents look at it again , and let us do so ourselves , in case some new effort can achieve something better .
The report now says that a product may be refused and removed from the list .
We also regret the adoption of an amendment authorizing anti-fouling products for ten years , even though we know that mechanical methods exist which make the use of these products superfluous .
Harmonization ought to take account of this and that implies a certain flexibility in the list to be prepared and a calm and accurate evaluation of the whole problem in all its breadth and complexity .
Our inclination is to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks and to correct the belief that biocidal products are necessarily always damaging to the environment and dangerous to human health .
The directive under discussion does not refer to a new sector but forms part of an already existing legal system governing chemical substances and preparations in general .
The increase in the number of biocidal products is alarming .
Our dependence on chemicals is a growing cause for concern .
Only a fraction of the almost 100 000 chemical products on the market have been authorized .
Some ECU 400 million is spent on biocidal products and more than ECU 11 billion spent on pesticides each year .
Because of the complexity and interdependence of the 20 or so existing directives on chemical products , understanding and interpreting this draft directive is not easy .
There is an urgent need , in this area , for the simplification of legal texts that was proclaimed in the Treaty on European Union , and I therefore wish to congratulate Mrs Jensen on her work .
Given the importance of this issue , and the support of the Commission and Parliament for Amendment No 95 , the Spanish socialist delegation will be voting in favour of this report .
The so-called ' biocidal ' products , such as disinfectants , products for treating wood , bird repellents , anti-slug agents , insecticides , etc. , are not ecologically harmless products .
Furthermore , this wide domain of chemistry has a substantial economic value .
It is , then , because it lies on the border between economics and ecology that this report arouses strong feelings .
I would like to say at once that I fully endorse Mrs Kirsten Jensen 's reservations regarding the ' automatic ' principle introduced into the directive .
This poses a problem for those countries whose ecological standards are high , and it presupposes the existence of authorities that are genuinely capable of making distinctions .
We need not only to enable consumers to protect themselves against chemical products whose side effects are little understood , but also to defend nature and wildlife against invasive chemistry .
That is why I strongly support Mrs Jensen 's report .
Oomen-Ruijten report
One of the fundamental principles of the European Union is that of subsidiarity .
In order for the Union to function effectively and in order for the people of Europe to have faith in cooperation , Community legislation must concentrate on those problems which national governments can only solve through cooperation .
In principle we believe that the EU should have nothing to do with issues such as this and that they are best dealt with at national level .
We have , however , chosen to support what is best for the consumer , and have therefore voted for the report .
We cannot support the amendments concerning the single currency , as we do not support the idea as such ; nor do we believe that it will come to pass .
From the consumer point of view we do not believe either that it will be easy to make sense of all the different prices which will be indicated .
Consumer protection and consumer information are both very important , especially in the internal market .
As a consumer , I wish to be informed about what I buy : informed about the content as well as the price .
I wish to be able to make objective comparisons .
Yes , ladies and gentlemen , objective !
In other words , distinctions must be drawn .
We have managed to achieve standardized sizes for many products on our markets .
Consumers benefit from being able to compare them .
This EC-wide harmonization was , moreover , an attempt to reduce the number of bottles in circulation by increasing recycling .
At the time , this was a major cost factor for the wine industry .
Not all wines are the same .
An objective approach is thus essential .
And let us carry out a cost-benefit analysis of all the rules that we adopt .
Conversion does not come cheap .
But where is the benefit for consumers ?
I think we have to draw distinctions .
Where standard sizes have already been introduced , it will be enough to go on indicating prices for these units .
Dual price indications should only be provided when it is objectively possible to compare prices , and therefore helpful for the consumer .
Talleyrand said everything which is exaggerated is insignificant .
I am bound to say that I could happily have accepted the Commission 's proposal , which seems to me to conform to the intended objective of protecting the consumer .
Such information would tell the consumer nothing .
All it would do would be to increase his confusion , a nonsensical result .
I trust that the amendment before us will be interpreted in this way , if it is adopted .
Too much information , especially irrelevant information , is counter-productive .
This option includes , in particular , products sold by the piece or unit .
Why delete this reasonable provision ?
Why impose abnormally short deadlines for the application of all these new obligations ?
I think that the Commission 's proposals are far more reasonable .
For all these reasons , I abstained .
Walter report
I have voted for the report . I regard it as a first attempt to illuminate the social consequences of EMU .
This does not mean I am in favour of EMU .
The report should also have looked at the changes which will take place as regards the instruments which may be used at national level to counter downturns in the economy , as they affect forestry for example .
In the long term , will tax and finance policies be decided at EU level too ?
The democratic process leading up to a decision on EMU is important .
It will be made easier if the advantages and disadvantages of EMU are better explained .
Referenda should be regarded as the obvious means of ensuring that EMU has the support of the people .
This report contradicts itself to a great extent .
Both in the explanatory memorandum and in a major part of the conclusions many of the negative traits of the current economic and social state of the European Union are recognised .
We tried to solve this contradiction by letting the peoples of Europe have a say and by proposing the conducting of constitutional referendums on a handover to a single currency , but this amendment was rejected .
Chernobyl disaster
Mr President , I have just voted for this report with the greatest of pleasure .
I would remind honourable Members that we have had a visit here from a delegation from the Ukraine . I myself was involved in this visit .
It emerged once more from the talks we had with the delegation just how complicated the situation in the Ukraine is .
But I should also reiterate the point made by many honourable Members in past debates , namely that there is no need to dismantle the two new nuclear power stations .
The old plant meets only 16 % of the Ukraine 's energy needs and it became apparent to us in the course of our discussions that the search for alternatives would be welcomed .
But the Ukraine - rightly - wants more than words and wants to see action .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted against the resolution , because I find that there is more hypocrisy here in the European Parliament than anywhere else .
Politicians are concerned not about whether we will survive a second Chernobyl , but only that the West European nuclear industry might not survive a second Chernobyl .
The European Union has failed lamentably .
It has left the nuclear industry to cope with the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster .
Not forgetting the Barents Sea , transformed into a vast radioactive dustbin where 30 , 000 fuel rods have been dumped and where 52 abandoned nuclear submarines represent 52 separate terrifying dangers .
The same is even true , I regret to say , of the Far North of Siberia , where there are nuclear dumping grounds for submarines .
To take account of this vast , tragic situation is the most urgent task confronting all the nations of Europe .
That is why we voted in favour of the text presented to us , whatever its deficiencies .
In this connection , let me cite the example of the pressurized water nuclear power station of Cattenom , which is in my own region .
For my part , I would have preferred the public funds to be invested in cogeneration rather than in the alleged improvement of existing power stations .
Still , ten years on , 7-8 % of the Lapps ' reindeer in North Bothnia are condemned because of excessive levels of caesium 137 .
A large proportion of natural raw products , such as game , fish , mushrooms and berries , are also unfit for human consumption on account of their caesium content .
25 % of elk have to be condemned and in the worst hit areas more or less all roedeer .
It is not unusual to find roedeer with 30 000 becquerels in the Gävle region - and all this despite the fact that the authorities promised ten years ago that all radioactivity would disappear very soon !
At the same time Sweden is one of the countries most dependent on nuclear power for its electricity supplies .
To implement the decision which has been taken to decommission all nuclear power stations by the year 2010 will not therefore be easy but it must be done nevertheless .
Persson has said that the decommissioning of nuclear power is an opportunity for development .
His industry minister , Anders Sundström , said yesterday that nuclear power as a source of energy was finished .
Sooner or later it would have to be phased out everywhere and it was good to be among the first .
The EU should listen to this Swedish minister .
Here in the European Parliament various committees have pronounced in favour of the phasing out of nuclear power , in favour of Euratom becoming a body for alternative energy .
If the European Parliament really wants to protect the future of the Union , a common plan for the phasing out of nuclear power should be very high on the agenda .
Visby Summit
It is four years since the Baltic Sea Council was established as a Danish-German initiative ( in April 1992 ) .
At the same time several parallels may be drawn between this new Baltic Sea Cooperation and Mediterranean Cooperation .
Secondly , because there is a high degree of similarity between the problems which the two fora for cooperation are intended to resolve .
Middle East situation
These text , once again , make no genuine peace proposals , and the peace of 1993 has failed .
Why ?
Because it strengthens the apartheid between Jews and Palestinians , an apartheid which is just as unacceptable as the form which once prevailed in South Africa , between the Bantu homelands and the predominantly European areas .
Well , on the basis of the noble ideas of peace , democracy and progress that everyone advocates , why not learn from the example of South Africa ?
I propose to this House the creation of a Federal Republic of the Middle East , constructed on the principles of equality and the rejection of exclusion .
In four words , one man , one vote .
It will comprise the territories of the former British mandate : Jordan , Israel and Palestine .
I have no doubt that the anti-racist Jewish leaders would accept this solution of universal citizenship , as the Whites did in South Africa .
My thanks to the ushers and officers for their attention .
The Green Group has voted for the joint resolution concerning the Baltic Sea conference , despite the fact that we regard it as being far too weak in many respects .
The environmental situation in the Baltic Sea is alarming , not least in respect of exhaust fumes from road transport and the risks from nuclear power stations .
The potential for alternative energy sources has not been exploited at all .
Two things must be halted at once : firstly , all efforts to shoot down the Middle East peace process through international terrorism ; and secondly , neutral population groups must no longer fall hostage to escalating military confrontation .
The international community should make it clear once and for all that what these countries are supporting is a criminal attack on peace , which must be condemned as international crime and dealt with accordingly .
Katyusha rockets have to be supplied and transported , and anyone who does so is collaborating in a crime against peace .
The international community should call to account the perpetrators and their accomplices , and do everything in its power to help the innocent people who have become involved .
That concludes voting time .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.30 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Madam President , just half a minute to mention a sad situation .
Again today another three East Timorese tried to seek refuge in the Dutch Embassy .
Madam President , indeed once again there has been a flare-up of the situation in East Timor , in relation to Indonesia .
I should like to say that the reaction of the police force and regime in Indonesia has now gone even further than that to which we were used and what we were already used to was bad .
Thank you , Mr Costa Neves .
Topical and urgent debate
The next item is the topical and urgent debate on subjects of major importance .
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
The choice of Auschwitz is no accident , since it is the very symbol of the Holocaust and more than a million Jews were massacred there .
We wish to express our solidarity not only with the memory of those who lost their lives as a result of Nazi barbarity but also with the Jewish community which has once more been outraged .
A serious warning is emanating at present from Poland .
For these reasons the plan to construct a commercial centre in the vicinity of the Lager of Auschwitz must be rejected once and for all .
In the next few weeks the 51st anniversary of the defeat of Nazism and fascism will be commemorated .
I was struck by the fact that the Polish authorities themselves resorted to a kind of trivialization of those tragic past events , as if no one bore any further responsibility for them .
And now we learn that preparations are under way , on the actual site of Auschwitz , for the building of a supermarket .
Whichever is worse , both are intolerable .
Auschwitz , obviously , is such a place .
And Mr Techkowski 's attitude shows us the lengths to which ultra-nationalistic abberations can go .
Let me add one further thought .
We are of course anxious about the attitude of Polish authorities , and it is indeed necessary for the European Union to be able to exert the necessary pressure .
There are grounds here , I am sorry to say , for doubt and anxiety .
These doubts and anxieties also underlie our motion for a resolution , and our vote in favour of the joint resolution .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen : Auschwitz - the very name will signal for ever the end of normality , since at Auschwitz the end of humanity was administered and implemented .
Those who support a return to the normality of supermarkets and anti-Semitic chanting at Auschwitz are seeking a return to the normality of barbarity and inhumanity .
But no one has a right to destroy justice , and those who wish to suppress freedom must have no freedom of opinion or association .
The European Parliament is therefore pleased that both the President and the government of Poland have condemned the building of a supermarket and the march by neo-Nazis at Auschwitz .
It is in fact in the first instance up to the Polish authorities to decide how to respond to the provocative acts of 6 April , and who must be called to account for them .
The answer to this question should be an unequivocal one .
How was it possible that our countries , with their civilization and culture rooted in Judaeo-Christian values and traditions , could allow the Jews of all people to be exterminated on so massive a scale ?
The Auschwitz concentration camp , the final resting place for millions of Jews , serves both as a memorial and a warning .
Here our young people can be taught what racism , antisemitism and xenophobia led to in our own time .
Here the nameless victims of the totalitarian nazi regime can be remembered with honour and respect .
I am speaking also for the rest of my Group when I say that recent events concerning Auschwitz shocked us very much .
The Polish Government only reacted to the local authority 's commercial plans after a protest from the Polish President and a number of groups .
In Poland itself there was little reaction to the demonstration .
Only one liberal Polish newspaper reacted directly to it . The line was that the actions of this insignificant neonazi group were disgusting , but hardly a threat to Poland 's democracy .
According to this newspaper the fact that democrats do not take to the streets to protest against antisemitism and racism constitutes a greater threat .
Techkowski 's neonazis are there for all to see , says the paper , but where are we ?
We share this concern about the Polish Government 's attitude and shall ask the same question in our own countries .
It is a question we must keep asking ourselves and the Polish Government .
The terrible truth of our history entitles us to do so .
Racism , antisemitism and xenophobia exist everywhere in the world .
We need to take action .
Where are we ?
Madam President , there is a great feeling of moral outrage in this Parliament at what has happened at Auschwitz .
We cannot morally cover up the past .
In a legal sense one can understand the local authority , but in a moral sense there is outrage at what it is trying to do .
It is significant that the President of Poland and the government of Poland seem to be in conflict with the local authority .
Madam President , I should like to express my absolute and total support for what has been said here by my colleagues .
How could I not do so ?
Fifty years ago , the Nazis were trying to destroy the camp at Auschwitz to erase the traces of their atrocities .
Of course , I myself and my group , like everyone else , can only and strongly condemn this demonstration , as we condemn all the attempts to impair the symbolic character of the Auschwitz camp .
For example , we condemn the proposal - which has been mentioned here - that a hypermarket should be built there .
We believe , Madam President , that the decision by the Polish authorities to authorize this neo-Nazi demonstration is unacceptable .
It is all the more worrying , to my mind , in that it goes hand in hand with a resurgence of racism and antisemitism in Poland .
I therefore welcome the fact that our Parliament considers it necessary to maintain a duty to commemorate all the victims of Nazi barbarity .
Madam President , I address the House on behalf of Mr Donnay , who is not here .
It is with some emotion , and also with some indignation , that I speak in this debate .
The Second World War and the atrocities which it produced cannot and must not be forgotten after no more than a few decades .
And yet , what is happening ?
There are plans today to build a supermarket on the site of Auschwitz , the location of the prison camp so grimly notorious for its exterminations .
This is an insult to the memory of a million men , women and children who were massacred on that site in the name of the ideological insanity of a few people .
I cannot accept the trivialization of such actions , because it is our duty to keep alive the collective memory , to ensure that such events can never happen again .
We will therefore support the text of the motion for a resolution tabled by all the groups .
We hope also that the places which witnessed the Stalinist barbarity and where the opponents of Marxism-Leninism were physically and morally annihilated may enter into the collective memory of the peoples of Europe .
I find this incomprehensible and an abomination .
And I think this is all the more alarming in that Poland is currently ruled by a post-Communist president , Mr Kwasniewski .
I would not have expected such events there , under such a government .
Reverence for the dead and the memory of this barbarity are of greater moral value than the democratic right to demonstrate freely .
We are therefore calling on all the institutions of the European Union to urge the Member States ' governments to prohibit such demonstrations .
And this applies above all to the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe , within whose borders many of these memorials are situated .
Demonstrations of this kind in front of a shrine to humanity must be condemned in the strongest possible terms .
Madam President , racist demonstrations are in every case deplorable and they must be condemned and where possible prevented .
That is certainly no easy task but one which we cannot shirk .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m .
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
The present situation is made worse by the fact that the disturbances affect Liberia , one of the African States which has long been independent , at least if we look at its original history .
The first concerns the thousands of Liberian boy-soldiers who need to be reintegrated into civilian society by means of school , occupational training and if necessary psychiatric help .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it really is an appalling situation to be forced , year after year , to consider the fate of a wretched country experiencing the same disasters over and over again !
Today , once again , that country is being carved up between more than half a dozen factions who are fighting over the wreckage following the collapse of the Government , which went down with all hands .
Chaos is the order of the day : bands of adolescents , intoxicated with drugs and alcohol , rounded up by gang leaders to indulge in slaughter and looting .
Clearly , we can no longer look to the Government for assistance here .
Instead , what we need is a military force , properly equipped , properly officered and properly trained , either to intervene or to keep order .
We cannot avoid this situation .
So let us have the courage to say so openly .
The latest attempt at a cease-fire was on 12 April and it has promptly collapsed .
But those who live in glass-houses should not throw stones .
You will note that the efforts of the world community get less energetic when only human lives are at stake rather than economic interests .
We totally condemn the savage crimes committed and the taking of hostages in this new round of hostilities .
The need for humanitarian aid is immense and exists not only in Liberia but in numerous neighbouring countries to which thousands of Liberian citizens have fled in fear of their lives .
The European Union , along with United Nations agencies and other international donors , must do everything possible to help provide and deliver the necessary supplies .
Renewed efforts need also to be made to prevent the delivery of arms and enforce the embargo approved by the United Nations .
It is tragic to reflect that a state begun as a homeland for liberated slaves should have degenerated into a hell on earth .
Madam President , the civil war in Liberia has flared up again for the umpteenth time .
A number of warring groups have been responsible for some 150 000 deaths in the seven years since 1989 .
Soldiers of the militias , but many more civilians , have been killed in the fighting .
The fighting has not stopped .
The groups appear to have become even more fragmented .
Recently on 6 April fighting broke out again when the police tried to arrest one of the warlords , Roosevelt Johnson , for his dubious role in the whole conflict .
One really wonders if it might not be best to detain all the leading activists who constantly cause this war to flare up again .
Since the war has been in progress the situation in the country has steadily worsened .
There is starvation , there are 100 000 refugees , there is a massive loss of health care and education and the country is gradually sliding into the abyss .
The question is what can be done ?
It is obvious to everyone that something has to be done in Liberia and I think it is equally obvious to everyone that Europe cannot just stand by and look on .
But my question to the Commissioner is this : what is Europe going to do here ?
It is precisely as one honourable Member said just now . Liberia is not a Kuwait .
We have no great economic interests there , but we are witnessing a tragedy in the making .
The umpteenth tragedy in Africa .
Liberia 's tragic situation forces Europe to launch an immediate political initiative to persuade the parties to the conflict to lay down their arms and start the process of material and economic reconstruction of the country .
My Group is convinced that ECOMOG must be given responsibility at international level for disarming the factions and for deploying its troops in the capital , Monrovia , and throughout the country .
We cannot remain indifferent to the agony of a whole country and people .
The European Union is the only international institution which today can help to create conditions of stability and peace in that country .
Now that many European and American residents have been evacuated there is a risk that all talk of the war in Liberia will cease , whereas the urgency for a political and diplomatic intervention remains the same .
The people of Africa do not deserve such suffering , such large-scale and senseless death .
Africa does not deserve to be condemned to oblivion , hopelessness , starvation and poverty .
Africa and its inhabitants do not deserve to be ruled by corrupt governments which hold sham elections in order to stay in power , by brutal dictators who become rich by consigning their people to poverty .
Liberia is just the latest episode in a collective tragedy which appears to have no end - and we cannot remain apart from all this .
We cannot stand by and watch the destruction of not only a country , but almost an entire continent - for we too shall pay the consequences of so much horror .
If action is not taken , other names will be added to those of Rwanda , Burundi , and now Liberia .
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly must take rigorous action .
I believe that the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is far more than simply an observatory ; it must also be a means of taking preventive measures and action .
We are now seeing that such a lengthy tradition of democracy has been incapable of stemming the tide of violent reaction .
Some colleagues have already referred to the problem of youngsters involved in military organizations .
Given these circumstances , we should consider how to enable the aid teams at least to protect themselves and their equipment , so that they too do not fall victim to the mob .
Madam President , in Monrovia , a week after the sudden flare-up of violence , the capital presents a scene of desolation that grows worse day by day .
How can we not condemn these acts of violence , which to make matters worse are being perpetuated by armed adolescents .
A catalogue of violence , murder , rape , looting and destruction of dwellings - that is the sad picture today .
And yet Monrovia had been relatively calm since 1993 and had never experienced this kind of conflagration in six years of civil war .
So what happened ?
Excluded from power because he has been found guilty of murder , the head of the Khran tribe , Roosevelt Johnson , unleashed a counter-attack which very rapidly developed into urban guerilla warfare .
The Khran rebels , holding some six hundred civilians hostage , used them as human shields .
The United States , whose historical links with Liberia we know , organized the evacuation of foreigners at a cost of millions of dollars .
The Americans responded with a literal flood of resources .
Five thousand American troops are in the region .
They were only too well aware that there was nothing more they could do and that the rebels had no respect for anything .
Madam President , as we know , the swift deterioration of the crisis in Liberia is having tragic consequences for the civilian population .
The European Commission fully shares the European Parliament 's anxiety and concern over the humanitarian situation on the ground there .
It became possible for thousands of armed fighters to enter Monrovia together with the faction leaders .
The attempt to arrest Johnson on 5 April last had more to do with factional politics than with justice .
His followers naturally resisted his arrest and within a few hours the situation had got totally out of hand .
As a result of the fighting hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed as they fled and most of Monrovia 's businesses and private houses were looted .
Unless peace is restored quickly it is to be feared that the already alarming situation will end in even greater disaster .
One of the many alarming aspects of the past week 's unrelenting violence was reports of attacks on the aid agencies .
Many aid workers were seriously harassed and their offices and living quarters were looted .
The UN headquarters was stripped bare .
Most of the non-governmental organizations have already lost their equipment and vehicles .
Most foreign personnel have been evacuated .
It is vital to keep this office going not least because many people are dependent on water supplies provided under an EU water project .
If things do not get better in the next few days the Commission too will have to pull its people out .
The Commission has contacted its NGO and UN partners on the possibility of an emergency aid programme .
A meeting is to be held in Brussels on 23 April with representatives of the main bodies currently or previously operating in Liberia .
The Commission emphasizes once again that it is prepared to look favourably on requests from the partners for humanitarian aid and that it will continue to monitor the situation .
The statement also stresses that the Abuja agreement remains the best hope for peace .
It is clear that the Council and Commission warmly and strongly support the continuing efforts spearheaded by the United Nations to get the parties to return to compliance with the agreement they concluded previously .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m .
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
China / Tibet
B4-0546 / 96 by Mr Carnero González and others , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group , on human rights in Colombia ; Morocco
B4-0542 / 96 by Mrs Elmalan and others , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group , on the human rights violations in Western Sahara ; Patrick Kelly
They are needed too because China 's constant refusal to engage in dialogue with Tibet damages the relations between the European Union and the People 's Republic of China .
We ask them too to hold a thorough , in-depth debate ahead of the vote in the UN Human Rights Commission .
I hope and expect that the Dutch Foreign Minster will be prepared to submit our resolution tomorrow in The Hague , when the Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen is present .
Madam President , unfortunately greed seems to be gaining ground in relations between the EU Member States and China .
For example , the President of Finland is currently in China with an 80-member trade delegation .
In my opinion it is completely impossible to condone this because China 's human rights record has really not improved at all .
Nor has there been any improvement in relations between China and Tibet ; on the contrary .
The genocide which has been going on for 40 years is still in full swing and it is the European Parliament 's responsibility to remind the Member States , the Council and the Commission continually of this terrible tragedy .
We must continually keep this matter in the public eye .
The UN Human Rights Commission should adopt the resolution defending human rights in China and the position of Tibet .
We probably owe this text to a sudden burst of guilty conscience on the part of the Union following Mr Li Peng 's visit to France .
On the Bakun hydroelectric power station in East Malaysia , Madam President .
It seems that things are not going smoothly with this dam which has long been a source of contention .
That worries us .
We fear that the building of this dam will destroy tropical rainforest and trample over the rights of indigenous communities in the area .
It is not the first time we have talked about this .
We adopted resolutions on it back in 1988 and 1993 , but other issues have emerged since then .
Loss of biodiversity as a result of clearing large areas of tropical rainforest is a very real fact and the environmental impact assessments are not satisfactory here .
We thus urge the Commission to remain vigilant and aware of this and to continue monitoring the huge consequences which this dam will have for the environment .
Undersea cables are planned to take power to peninsula Malaysia and nobody is really sure if the whole thing is necessary at all .
But in 1992 the project was resurrected .
It puts in serious doubt Malaysia 's commitment to manage its forests in a sustainable manner .
Fortunately , European Union funding is not being used here .
The hope , with this resolution , is to press European investors , construction companies and world bodies to pull out .
Madam President , 20 years ago , when I worked in Malaysia for a while , there was considerable concern that the Bakun dam might be built .
That time has now come .
Forest clearance and construction work have already begun , even though the government declared in 1990 that the project was to be shelved for environmental reasons .
After the confrontations which have taken place , we are very afraid that human rights are being abused .
What , we wonder , will happen to the rights of the people living in the region ?
How will their traditional , established rights - which are partially unwritten - be protected ?
What measures are being taken to resettle and protect them ?
We hear from Malaysia that the whole process is flawed .
There are flaws in the legal procedure for the environmental impact assessment : it has been split into four separate parts , and construction work has started even though not all of these have been carried out .
Such a procedure is intolerable from a legal point of view , and some of the demands of the local population have not been met .
I think it is essential for the Commission to raise this problem in its negotiations with Malaysia .
We simply cannot accept such goings-on .
Other European firms should also bring their operations there to an end .
Madam President , once again , we have to raise the subject of Western Sahara , the defence of the Sahrawi people and their right to self-determination , and the need for the referendum which is being constantly delayed .
In the motion for a resolution which our group tabled this week , we refer to this indirectly .
The United Nations resolutions stipulated that a referendum on the selfdetermination of the Sahrawi people should have been completed by the end of 1992 , but we are still discussing this subject today .
Also as regards Colombia , sadly , we must once again speak of human rights violations .
Not only in Colombia , but also in Bolivia and other Latin American countries , impunity is the word which is constantly on the lips of all defenders of human rights .
The motion for a resolution which we are introducing today refers to nine more murders which we fear will go unpunished - in the same way as the 94 other murders committed in recent years .
And Colombia is afflicted not only by drug trafficking and murders , but also by the permanent conditions of poverty and injustice which give rise to these scourges .
We therefore urge President Samper not to succumb to the temptation of approving the reintroduction of the death penalty , as this will only make the situation in Colombia worse .
Madam President , the situation in Colombia is deteriorating day by day .
That is nothing new ; you know that from the papers , from television and the radio .
The controversy surrounding President Samper is undermining the authority of the Government , which has to contend with continuing bloodbaths .
The Colombian Government must do everything possible to halt the spiral of violence , human rights abuses and other activities which undermine the rule of law .
On the contrary , they merely lead to a further escalation .
Instead the Government must bring those responsible for the killings to justice and take responsibility itself for seeing that human rights are upheld by the forces of law and order .
Only if the Government itself shows respect for the rule of law can it persuade others to do likewise .
Madam President , I want to speak on the motion on Patrick Kelly , which is a resolution before you under the human rights heading .
Patrick Kelly is an Irish citizen who is a prisoner in Northern Ireland and who is suffering from cancer and is critically ill .
The resolution requests his transfer on humanitarian grounds to Portlaoise prison where he will be nearer to his family .
He has only seen his three-yearold daughter a few times since she was born .
It takes his family 11 hours to complete the round trip from their home to the prison where he is presently incarcerated .
He has applied for such a transfer so that he can spend whatever time remains to him close to his family .
In view of the Convention and his rapidly deteriorating health I call , on behalf of the Socialist Group , for his immediate transfer in the interests of justice and decency .
We are joined in this request by politicians from parties in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland , including colleagues from the Irish Labour Party who have visited Mr Kelly on numerous occasions .
A petition has been signed for his transfer by 85 % of members of the Irish Parliament , including Dick Spring , the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs .
In conclusion , I want to point out that no logical or legal impediment exists to prevent Mr Kelly 's transfer to Portlaoise prison .
I would ask all Members of the House to support the motion .
I believe that there are powerful humanitarian and compassionate reasons for this request ; reasons that will surely convince the British authorities to allow him to be transferred to a prison near his family .
Patrick Kelly is gravely ill and his health continues to deteriorate .
This situation has caused enormous hardship and distress to his family who , in visiting him , are all too aware of the precarious state of his health .
Transferring Mr Kelly to a prison which is in the jurisdiction of the Republic of Ireland would be clearly of great benefit to him and greatly alleviate the anguish being felt by his family .
Bearing these factors in mind , I urge the British authorities , in a spirit of compassion and humanitarianism , to accede to the request for Mr Kelly 's transfer .
There is growing support for such a move .
Political parties in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland are very supportive .
I hope that my British colleagues in Parliament would acknowledge the importance of this matter and would also lend their support .
It is overwhelmingly evident that the case of Patrick Kelly meets these humanitarian requirements .
Madam President , I welcome the fact that this resolution is on the agenda today .
Britain has ignored calls from all sides , both North and South , on the Kelly issue .
Kelly is a 44-year-old prisoner who is seriously ill .
I do not think it is very good for the peace process in Northern Ireland to take this approach .
The Home Secretary , Michael Howard , is an absolute disgrace for refusing to transfer somebody who is seriously ill .
It is absolutely disgraceful that one person is treated in one way and another in another , particularly taking into account that Patrick Kelly was sentenced to 25 years for conspiracy .
Conspiracy , do not forget , is not when a crime is committed but when a person conspires to commit a crime .
Some people have serious doubts about this kind of conviction .
In addition , he was denied medical treatment for over a year .
The British authorities were aware of the fact that the skin cancer that Kelly had could reoccur .
It was over a year afterwards , and only after appeals from the Irish Government , that they gave him access to a cancer specialist .
This did not need to happen .
There is a high recovery rate from melanoma .
It is very important in future that this does not happen .
That is why we have two amendments down to this resolution .
We do not think it is strong enough .
We would like the fact that he was denied treatment to be recognized and that it should not happen to any other prisoner .
Secondly , we would also like to see the European Parliament playing a much stronger role in relation to human rights abuses within the European Union .
This proposal is also supported by many human rights lawyers who are working on these issues .
I do not think that Britain is respecting its responsibilities under the European Convention on the transfer of sentenced prisoners because this convention actually provides for transfer of prisoners for humanitarian reasons .
Patrick Kelly is a prime example of humanitarian reasons .
Madam President , the Convention on the transfer of sentenced prisoners is in force throughout Europe and is being extensively used .
All applications between Ireland and the UK are being looked at on humanitarian grounds .
This is one of the key grounds on which transfer requests are made .
Prisoners have to be treated as prisoners and Patrick Kelly was found in possession of a considerable amount of explosives .
But they should be allowed to serve their sentences as close as possible to their families .
This could be achieved either by way of transfer to Irish jurisdiction , which the Irish Government has repeatedly requested , or by a decision by the British authorities to release him on compassionate grounds .
Every case is special .
Patrick Kelly 's association with events in Northern Ireland makes his proposed transfer perhaps more sensitive than most .
All I can say is that the sympathetic consideration of this case is of paramount importance in the context of our continuing efforts to sustain the peace process in Northern Ireland .
Indeed , I believe that the issue of prisoner transfer is central to the outcome of the peace process .
Senator Mitchell in his report also emphasized this point .
If we are to have a successful outcome to the proposed negotiations on 10 June , I believe that the transfer of Mr Kelly will be a crucial issue in the outcome and success of these talks .
I believe it should be addressed urgently both because of its potentially damaging impact on confidence and for basic humanitarian motives .
I would like to thank all the political groups in Parliament who have supported this joint resolution .
However , I would like to make one point about the two amendments from the Green Party .
I have already signified my own willingness and anxiety to visit the prisoners in England .
I do not believe that many Members of this Parliament can support the amendments because of the language used .
Unfortunately , we will not be able to support them .
However , my group will be voting in favour of the resolution .
May we return to China , Madam President ?
The attention of the whole world is fixed on that great country and especially on the market opportunities it offers .
Eagerness to take advantage of them brings a willingness to turn a blind eye to the inhuman situations there which we have repeatedly debated .
The recent aggression against Taiwan has also caused many Asian countries to rethink their policy on China .
Much criticism has been voiced in Parliament about the upholding of human rights in Asian countries and sometimes we even go so far as to call in our resolutions for a halt to investment .
I have never as yet heard anything like that said about China , so there is a bit of a double standard here .
Madam President , investors can improve working conditions in a country , but not its whole policy on human rights .
But if investors are backed by the criticism of 15 Member States the country concerned will have to take that on board sooner or later .
So the resolution represents a call by Parliament for the EU and UN to send a signal to China .
I visited China recently and went to Tibet .
I was present at the opening of the academic session of the Europe China Business School in Shanghai .
The timing of this resolution is that of the United Nations .
I am conscious that a delegation visiting Parliament today from China is deeply disturbed by this matter and I simply report that to the House .
The leader of that delegation Mr Zhu Qizhen said this morning that the Asia / Europe parliamentary partnership meant a dialogue .
We need that dialogue . The European Parliament should not just be about business as usual but about politics as usual .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking as chairman of the Interparliamentary Delegation for Relations with China .
I think that the duties of hospitality to some extent justify him and that we cannot fail to take account of that .
Madam President , concerning the position of Mr Patrick Kelly .
The European Parliament , as we have seen , has reason to be concerned for the fate of this seriously ill man , Patrick Kelly , who as we have heard is a detainee in Northern Ireland .
The European Parliament is particularly eager to uphold human rights in areas where they sometimes come under pressure as a result of political problems .
It would not be right for Kelly , who is suffering from skin cancer , to be the victim of setbacks in the Irish peace process .
It ought to be possible to separate he fate of this sick man from the controversy - to put it mildly - which surrounds the Irish peace process .
I hope that these calls for the British Government to show humanity will be heard and that the Government will show the necessary flexibility and political sensitivity in respect of the European Convention on the transfer of sentenced persons .
The European Parliament , Madam President , has a reputation to maintain on human rights both inside and outside the Union .
We must not sit on our hands in this case either .
To my mind this is also the central requirement in the resolution , the original resolution now before us .
I would find it most regrettable if all the amendments aimed at changing it were accepted , because the resolution would then lose its importance .
Mr President , China seems likely to feature permanently in our debates on topical and urgent matters .
The Tibetan question has been raised here on more than one occasion , including that of a visit by the Dalai Lama himself .
Has that ever cut any ice with China ?
On the contrary , it seems that the policy of genocide against Tibet continues unabated and with no less brutality .
On the contrary we all know that all the time , and this very day in Parliament , the red carpet is being rolled out for the Chinese communists .
I will end there , Mr President .
I shall vote for the compromise resolution , but in my view it does not go far enough .
It is most confusing .
I have very little to add really to everything that has already been said on the subject of Colombia .
Mr President , I can only endorse Mrs d ' Ancona 's request .
It is something for which this House has long been calling .
Today we are asking yet again about the European Union 's priorities at the Geneva meeting , particularly as regards the subject of China .
I myself had the opportunity of raising these issues at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva last week .
One of the critical resolutions submitted there relates to the human rights situation in China and Tibet , to which we ourselves have often drawn attention .
Our resolution puts us very much on the same wavelength as our Member States and the European Union in Geneva .
But that in no way alters any of our arguments or responses .
Mr President , I am now speaking on the motion for a resolution on Western Sahara .
We have already adopted many resolutions on Western Sahara , all of them with the same basic tenor : recognition of the West Saharan people 's right to self-determination .
The resolution before us today , however , deals with a very specific case , that of Mrs Keltoum El Ouanat .
She was arrested on 10 October 1992 for having taken part in a peaceful demonstration in Smana calling for the right of self-determination .
What we are entirely free to do here leads to being arrested there .
She was sentenced to 20 years ' imprisonment by a military court in 1993 .
I regard this as an intolerable violation of human rights by Morocco .
Both we and the UN should take up this case .
The peace process must be supported here , and the matter brought before the 52nd session of the UN Commission on Human Rights which is currently taking place .
Mr President , one of the major reasons for the European Convention on the transfer of sentenced prisoners was , obviously , humanitarian .
That is the central and only point of this resolution and I am very grateful that it is being supported by all groups in this House .
Other issues which relate to the peace situation in Northern Ireland do not come into this debate .
This is a straightforward , central , humanitarian request to allow a human being , who is seriously ill with a life-threatening disease , to be as close to his family as possible .
Successive governments have offered these armed groups the possibility of dialogue and reintegration into the political process .
However , when former guerrillas rejoin civilian life , they are frequently murdered by more radical elements in their group .
Secondly , the guerrilla groups are playing havoc with the Colombian military , which is sometimes obliged to respond to their attacks .
And thirdly , we cannot address the subject of Colombia without mentioning the drug cartels .
There is frequently close cooperation between the guerilla groups and the drug traffickers , and there are often violent clashes between the different criminal organizations .
In any event , we must not forget that the political situation in Colombia is currently in a particularly delicate phase .
Now more than ever , therefore , we must be aware of the need to defend and support the democratic institutions and the rule of law in Colombia .
Mr President , it has just been said once again that this is a question of a colonial war and self-determination in Western Sahara .
Let me emphasize that the first country to propose self-determination in the Sahara was Morocco .
Since then , the Polisario has persistently been following a policy of obstruction , doing all it could to deprive the region 's new inhabitants of the right to self-determination .
Much has changed in the past 25 years , and this has led to a different population structure .
There is no reason to ignore these elements , however , and to keep harking back to the circumstances of over 20 years ago .
It is wrong to do so , in my view .
I am all in favour of the young lady being released , to the extent that this is an issue of human rights , but I am not in favour of linking that with political untruths .
Mr President , a few words on China to begin with , since so many speakers have talked about China .
Regarding Tibet , the Union has always sought to promote direct dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the representatives of the Tibetan people .
This reflects the European Union 's firm belief that a positive approach forming the basis for a constructive relationship is probably the best way of achieving progress .
Confrontation would very probably not only achieve nothing ; it would actually be counterproductive .
In recent weeks and months the European Union has constantly sought to establish a real dialogue with China based on constructive cooperation .
We acted in close concert with the United States on this , primarily by making joint approaches to many member states of the UN Commission on Human Rights .
Results to date are admittedly not too promising but we must not give up .
Mr President , several honourable Members have referred to the Bakun dam .
The Commission is aware that the Malaysian Government decided recently to continue with the building of this dam in Sarawak , East Malaysia .
In its cooperation with Malaysia the Commission has always consistently taken account of Parliament 's resolutions on Sarawak , from 1988 onwards .
These point out the negative effects of wholesale deforestation .
Mr Eisma did so again .
The Malaysian Government is also waiting for the results of the environmental impact assessment for this project , which appears to be split into three parts .
The European Commission does not yet know if this study will be made public .
Mr President , the Commission has long been monitoring the human rights situation in Colombia .
It also shares Parliament 's concern at the Colombian President 's announcement that the death penalty is to be reintroduced .
Abuses of the kind listed in the draft resolution now under discussion will continue to be systematically targeted by the Commission .
Thank you , Mr van den Broek .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m .
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Mr President , the G7 + 1 summit is taking place today in Moscow on disarmament matters .
Parliament 's Committee on Civil Liberties has already looked at the black market in nuclear materials .
In a world ravaged by terrorism it does not take much imagination to realize the kind of world disasters into which such a trade might lead us .
Thus it is our fervent hope that this point too may be considered at the G7 + 1 summit in Moscow .
Mr President , we have too few reasons for satisfaction in this House not to emphasize those we do have .
Well , the year 1996 could be a decisive year for the decline of the detestable ideology of military strength based on nuclear power .
' We are capable of doing to you what you dare not do to us . '
That was how , not so long ago , we justified out claim to the humanitarian high ground .
Finally , let me return to the blatant proposal by Mr Chirac , a few months ago , that France 's nuclear resources should be employed in the services of the defence of Europe .
We should be glad to obtain further details of his idea , and especially to know how it would fit into the institutional structure of the Union .
Mr President , every opportunity must be grasped to bring the talks on a comprehensive test ban treaty to a successful conclusion .
The talks are exceptionally difficult but of course they are not unimportant .
Following the assent of France , the USA , Russia and the United Kingdom it is very important that the momentum should be sustained .
We continue to favour a zero option without a safeguard clause with good monitoring of implementation .
The peaceful nuclear testing which China wants are undesirable .
The door must remain closed to nuclear testing .
Today 's joint resolution is thus right to press for the Duma to ratify START II .
There are so many encouraging signals such as the various ' nuclear-free zones ' which have been agreed that we must now do everything possible to get the CTBT completed .
The European Parliament has already , on 15 February , called for his release .
Numerous petitions and resolutions have been drawn up urging his release , signed by the former President of the Commission Jacques Delors , among others .
We know that there is a mafia , disorder and chaotic tendencies in Russia .
A person such as Alexandr Nikitin should in such circumstances be regarded as a great champion of peace who should receive the full support of the European Union .
An overwhelming majority of people everywhere would come out against nuclear weapons and in favour of nuclear disarmament .
This Parliament , which represents the citizens of Europe , is directing a renewed plea to this effect to the participants in the G7 + 1 Conference , and to all politicians .
We in Europe should of course set an example and show the world that peace reigns in Europe .
The European Parliament is launching a powerful appeal to this effect to the conference on disarmament .
The summit will be endorsing a number of political declarations in this regard .
I will take this opportunity , Mr President , of briefing Parliament on the objectives the European Commission will be pursuing at this summit .
Fourthly , aid must continue under programmes such as PHARE and TACIS with a view to improving reactor safety .
In conclusion , though it hardy needs saying , Mr President , the Union is firmly in favour of strengthening non-proliferation and wishes to promote it further .
We have lent our support to several measures designed to achieve that aim , notably the aim of extending the Non-Proliferation Treaty , which has been mentioned today .
The European Union naturally supports the negotiations currently under way , and also favours an end to nuclear testing .
Mr President , I believe that this is indeed an important summit in that it will raise and broaden awareness on issues such as nuclear safety and nonproliferation .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m .
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
The Agreement and other measures must be implemented .
Nobody in this Parliament has any doubts about that .
We would all prefer not to think about what the consequences would be if the package failed .
There is still hope , however , Mr President - hope that the efforts now being made will result in a permanent peace in Bosnia even after the withdrawal of IFOR .
Nevertheless , we are very concerned about the situation in Kosovo . Everything is going in the wrong direction there at present .
How long can we expect the Albanians to put up with being cruelly oppressed and humiliated ?
What will happen when the bomb goes off ?
Mr President , in November of last year I was approached during the OSCE meeting in Warsaw by a man from Kosovo who was of Albanian extraction .
Kosovo is a vital part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which will , if prevented from developing satisfactorily , radiate a dangerous and negative influence into the surrounding area .
So it is crucial to this area 's development that Belgrade should begin talks with the elected representatives of Kosovo .
My Group regards this as an important prerequisite before the EU restores diplomatic ties with Yugoslavia and lifts the economic sanctions which are still in force .
Consequently it is regrettable that a number of EU Member States believe that the time is right to recognize Yugoslavia .
In general many obstacles remain to recovery in Yugoslavia .
In short , things are not looking good .
The Council and Commission thus need to keep their finger firmly on the pulse .
To come back to Kosovo , my Group endorses the proposal for an international conference on Kosovo and it would be a good idea to set up an EU office there .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the number of debates held by Parliament on this subject is almost legion .
But new elements keep appearing , and it is always helpful to explore them .
A second aspect of the resolution relates to the fact that an increasing number of Western governments , apart from the USA , are recognizing Serbia-Montenegro .
I find this reckless , or short-sighted to say the least .
What other pressure can we exert to compel Belgrade to solve the Kosovo question once and for all ?
But this could change very quickly unless the situation receives the necessary attention from Europe and the world at large .
Some of these positions are expressed by this motion for a resolution .
Nevertheless , I want to express certain reservations about the positions adopted by the joint compromise motion for a resolution by certain groups concerning the Kosovo problem .
It is true that in Kosovo human rights are being flagrantly suppressed , and it is true that Kosovo 's autonomous character under the Constitution of the former Yugoslavian Republic has been revoked .
I think the European Union should take greater care to give real support to the rights of Kosovo 's Albanian population .
I do not wish to reply to Mr Alavanos ; there is no point .
I would merely ask you to ensure that all Members are treated in the same way as myself , that is all .
Mr Alavanos was allotted one minute and spoke for two .
I am sorry , but that must not happen again .
Mrs Pack , I have never cut a speaker off during his or her speech .
I simply confine myself to indicating - albeit quite forcefully - when a speaker 's time is up .
Mr Alavanos originally had one minute 's speaking time , but he informed me that another member of his group had given him his minute .
I waited until the two minutes were up , and then I indicated that to Mr Alavanos .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make the point that I personally have the most explicit reservations regarding everything relating to Kosovo in the motions for resolutions that have been put before us .
Always as far as the former Yugoslavia is concerned , I have learnt , during this Parliament or the previous one , that it was difficult to swim against the tide of the prevailing ideas .
However , I do not allow that to discourage me .
It was premature to recognize the independence of Slovenia , of Croatia , of Bosnia and even of Macedonia .
That step should have been preceded by precautions enabling all the populations to be associated with it , and a Yugoslav confederation to be constructed and associated with our European Union .
And so we brought about precisely what we were pretending to fear .
In Bosnia , we asserted our principles : independence , territorial integrity of a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural entity .
We asserted those principles so intrinsically that many Bosnians thought they could take what we said literally and paid with their lives for European cowardice .
I do seriously urge you , ladies and gentlemen , not to start the same process again tomorrow .
So soon after the flames have died down in Bosnia , let us not throw oil on the smouldering embers - and they are smouldering !
- in Kosovo .
The road to hell , as we know , is paved with good intentions .
Admittedly , the rights of the Albanians in Kosovo must be defended .
Admittedly the excesses committed in the name of autonomy until 1989 triggered a process of recentralization which highlighted certain equally deplorable excesses .
But that is not to say that one injustice can be remedied by committing another .
We cannot pretend to aid Kosovo while ignoring the position of Serbia , of which Kosovo forms part and , indeed , represents the historic heart .
None of us would accept similar interference in his own country .
We cannot transfer to the case of Kosovo diplomatic and economic sanctions which , rightly or wrongly , were adopted in order to resolve the Bosnian crisis .
The way to a lasting , just solution to the problems of this region is via an open , positive and constructive dialogue between the European Union and the Republic of Yugoslavia .
Let us have no more of this anti-Belgrade oversimplification , an oversimplification which , in this case , can only lead to another war .
Similarly , in line with the conclusions of the last donors ' conference , held in Brussels on 12 and 13 April , the European Union must step up its efforts to assist the rebuilding of former Yugoslavia .
Only on this basis will it be possible to make progress in the process of democratization and the defence of human rights in the territory of former Yugoslavia .
Thank you , Mr Mohamed Alí .
As you said at the beginning of your remarks , that was your maiden speech in the European Parliament .
Thank you , Mr Mohamed Alí .
Mr President , on Yugoslavia we have reached a stage where progress has been made , but you cannot say that the peace process has been consolidated and stability assured .
Pressure , political urging and even an insistence on preconditions is still needed to take the process forward .
There is nothing I need to say about I-FOR .
It is now fully operational and , I think , working well .
Our attention is now fully focused on completion of the civilian part of the Dayton Agreement , which the EU 's representative Carl Bildt is responsible for coordinating .
The reconstruction work is beginning clearly to take shape .
One thing which cast a shadow over the conference was the absence of the Bosnian Serbs .
They actually excluded themselves despite the fact that our aid effort is directed in principle at the whole of Bosnia Herzegovina and thus at the Republika Srpska too .
But the absence of the Bosnian Serbs incontrovertibly shows how much influence is still exerted by people suspected of war crimes , Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic .
It proves too how important it is that these alleged war criminals should be arrested and brought before the international tribunal .
Their continuing presence will be an enduring and unacceptable obstacle to stability and will also hamper our reconstruction work in the Republika Srpska .
Responsibility for the success or failure of the peace process depends also and primarily on the parties themselves ; they must demonstrate a genuine will for peace .
The same goes for the continuance of the Muslim-Croat Federation in Bosnia .
Lastly a brief word on relations with Serbia-Montenegro since a number of speakers have touched on that at length this afternoon .
It is perhaps opportune to make the point that the European Union needs to pursue a coherent , consistent and clear policy on recognition of the republics of former Yugoslavia .
That is the position which the Union has maintained for months now and I see no reason to change it .
Finally may I draw your attention to the passage in paragraph 11 of the resolution which talks of calling on the Council to instruct the Commission to open an office in Kosovo .
May I point out that institutionally this causes me some difficulty in that it is not for the Council to instruct the Commission whether or not it should open an office in Kosovo .
In all seriousness , we have enormous problems at present , budget restrictions , which make it difficult for us to open delegations in a lot of important countries .
We do not even have an official delegation in Sarajevo yet .
I am sure you will agree that this should have priority .
But for the rest I readily agree with much of what has been said about Kosovo .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m .
The topical and urgent debate on subjects of major importance is now closed .
( The sitting was suspended until 5.30 p.m. )
Mr Pasty has the floor on a point of order .
Mr President , I would just like to make a comment .
I am absolutely delighted by the vote which has just been taken , but I note that , since voting began , the quorum has not existed .
I have not asked for the quorum to be established , but I have observed , as a result of the electronic votes , that there are not 207 Members present in this House , and I deplore that .
Are you asking for the quorum to be established , Mr Pasty ?
I am not asking for that , I am simply saying that no quorum exists .
In any event , Mr Pasty , let me thank you for your observations .
At the same time , however , I must tell you that they will have absolutely no effect on the result of the vote .
Mr Falconer has the floor on a point of order .
If at some time you wish to initiate a debate on that subject , there are ways in the House for you to do so .
He himself drew my attention to it .
The paragraph talks of calling on the Council to instruct the Commission , etc. , and naturally that cannot be correct .
It is not possible under the Treaty , so I would ask you to substitute the following ' Requests the Commission to open an office in Kosovo ' .
It will make very little difference , because the Commissioner has already said that there is no money for it .
Thank you for that clarification , Mr Bertens .
1994 Cohesion Fund ( continuation )
I should like to begin by congratulating him , since I believe that he has drawn up a considered , objective and unbiased report on the very important subject of the implementation of the Structural Funds in 1994 .
At the present time , Spain 's economy is in relatively good shape .
However , these are also funds which are serving to bring our infrastructure up to a level which is necessary to foster not only competitiveness , but also social cohesion .
It is also a well known fact that for every 100 ECU handed out by the structural funds , 45 ECU benefit the less-developed countries of the European Union .
Madam President , cohesion is more correctly referred to as economic and social cohesion .
However , even a microscope will hardly reveal the social element of projects funded from the Cohesion Fund .
It is not just common knowledge , but is actually stated in the document ' Europe 2000 + ' , that investment in transport stimulates development in regions where growth is already strong .
At a hearing in the Committee on Regional Policy , the Spanish Secretary of State for the Environment said that this was leading to greater polarization in the economic power of some central regions .
The point here is that environmental projects do not always protect the environment .
For example , under the ' green dot ' system introduced in Germany , waste is eliminated simply by changing its name from waste to ' recyclable material ' .
This avoids having to avoid waste .
The system has caused one environmental scandal after another , and a study is now being financed with a view to trying out a similar scheme in Portugal .
This is how the reserves of the new structural policy are being used .
The present annual report will surely be the last one where cohesion funding is paid out without respecting the convergence criteria .
Things are going to change in the future .
In future , in fact , the disadvantaged regions will be even more disadvantaged .
If we are wondering how to set about reforming the structural policy , the Cohesion Fund springs to mind .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Costa Neves , on his excellent report .
On the other hand , the funds have been properly administered and the projects completed on time .
This proves that the beneficiary countries have been keen to use the opportunities provided by the Cohesion Fund to move closer to the goal of convergence .
However , the increased attention being given to projects to protect the environment , such as water supplies and the treatment of waste water and other waste , is welcome .
But the approval of projects must be subject to a proper environmental impact assessment .
Madam President , despite solemn promises I have not received a Swedish translation .
I regret this and am therefore compelled to read out the text which my colleague Mrs Wulf-Mathies drew up in German .
I trust the honourable Members will excuse my German .
This is what my colleague wanted to say :
It is a pleasure to discuss with you today the resolution produced by Mr Costa Neves on the complementary report on the Cohesion Fund ( 1994 ) .
As last year , I note with satisfaction the many positive remarks and constructive criticisms made by Parliament about particular policy aspects of the Cohesion Fund and its administration .
Let me take up some of these points .
Secondly , the ' polluter pays ' principle forms the basis of action in the environment sector .
I welcome your comments concerning our success in improving the balance between the environment and transport , and in promoting rail transport .
I have already notified the Member States that further discussion is to be held with the European Parliament in this respect .
At the same time , however , the Commission must remain within its legal bounds .
As the legislation stands , local and regional authorities and the social partners are not entitled to be involved in project selection .
However , it is an important step in the right direction that local bodies do now take part in monitoring committee meetings when projects based on local initiatives are under consideration .
This constitutes a direct incentive for the Member State concerned to adapt its budgetary decisions accordingly .
A suspension of aid is preceded by a comprehensive review , which means that small divergences from the set targets in absolute terms can be allowed for , as can any irregularities undetected by a Member State .
Basing decisions on forecasts inevitably entails a degree of uncertainty , which must be taken into account and evaluated very carefully before a final decision is made .
The facts of the matter are these : in September 1994 , the Council established that - unlike Ireland - Spain , Portugal and Greece had excessive budget deficits .
The Council 's recommendation therefore set specific targets for these three countries for 1995 . In July 1995 , the Council confirmed these 1995 targets and set new ones for 1996 .
An investigation this spring , once the 1995 figures are available , will show whether or not the targets for 1995 were met .
If aid is suspended in spring 1996 , it can be reinstated in autumn 1996 , as long as the forecast indicates that the Member State is likely to meet its target for 1996 .
In any event , the Commission will inform Parliament immediately about any decision to suspend aid .
Thank you , Mrs Gradin .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m .
North-South cooperation and the campaign against drugs
Forty to fifty million people worldwide are addicted to illegal drugs - the fate of any one individual is awful enough to demand action .
The Committee on Development and Cooperation has presented a report , which it adopted unanimously , to contribute to solving the problem .
The crops used to manufacture drugs are cultivated primarily in three areas : in the Andean countries , the countries which form the ' golden crescent ' , and the countries of the ' golden triangle ' in Asia .
A crucial reason for the concentration of cultivation in developing countries is the dire poverty of the people in those regions .
When the alternative is to grow coca or suffer abject poverty and death , the Mafia has an easy task .
Development cooperation is therefore essential , not only in the EU 's own interests , but also out of solidarity with the people concerned in this area .
It cannot be stressed often enough that the problem of drugs is also a problem of development .
Europe realized too late in the day the need for joint measures to combat the drugs problem , and we are still being too tentative .
I take exception to any nationalist attitudes in this area : we must act together .
The question ' should drugs be legalized - yes or no ? ' has exercised the House on more than one occasion .
On the substance of the matter , too , I came out at a very early stage against liberalization , because I believe that such an approach would solve nothing .
That was very beneficial to the committee 's work , and I should like to thank all those colleagues who were of assistance .
So how should the resources from this budget line be spent ?
The European Parliament created the budget line ' North-South cooperation in the campaign against drugs and drug addiction ' in 1987 .
The total take-up of funds up to the end of 1995 was ECU 75.68 million .
Clearly , there can be no effective campaign to combat the problem simply by activating these funds , since the turnover of the drugs mafia is many times greater .
The Commission proposes that initiatives could be funded under the UNDCP programme in particular , for example aid to monitor and combat the drugs trade .
I think that we should save this money , and the committee agrees with me .
It would be preferable to devote the money to specific projects , because calling into question the GSP preferences - even indirectly - would send the wrong signal to the developing countries .
These preferences must be maintained and in fact extended .
One cannot always prove whether one cabbage imported by the European Union replaces one coca plant ; the problem is far more complex than that .
It is all to do with sending out a political signal and with the shaping of opinion in the countries concerned .
We focus on alternative development .
Alternative development means offering producers alternatives so that they are no longer dependent on the cultivation of drugs .
It is not enough simply to promote substitute crops : technical knowhow , infrastructure and marketing structures are needed too .
All this must be provided .
There are some very good projects in this area which are extremely successful .
But I wish to thank all my other colleagues too .
I wish to state emphatically on behalf of the committee , and also on behalf of the members of the Committee on Budgets , that in our view , this is an impertinence .
If the Council is of a different opinion , we shall find ways of asserting our rights through the budgetary procedure .
I thank you for your attention , and urge you to support this report from the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
Madam President , the road to hell is paved with good intentions .
When I say hell , of course , I mean the hell of drug addiction .
As for good intentions , the proposal for a Council regulation which is before us today is a perfect illustration of such intentions .
However , although we believe that it is necessary to help those countries , the draft which is proposed to us today leaves us sceptical .
First , it is inconsistent .
Parliament has on several occasions expressed its opinion as to how the campaign against drugs should be conducted , especially at international level .
We regret the fact that this proposal takes insufficient account of that opinion , and that it refers only to the United Nations International Drug Control Programme .
Moreover , the overall budget that would be allocated to the project is too limited for the latter to be really effective .
In this respect , we would like to have a more accurate idea of what activities will be financed .
Moreover , the committee has already emphasized the need for a global campaign against the consequences of poverty and the promotion of a genuine programme of education in the developing countries .
We should not choose the wrong target and be too precipitate in pointing the finger at the developing countries .
The synthetic drugs that have appeared in the Western countries prove that .
The Ecstasy taken by young Europeans in Amsterdam or in Paris is just as harmful as the glue sniffed by street children in Rio or Mexico City .
Consequently , only a genuine codevelopment policy will enable us to take effective action against this scourge , both here and there .
Happily the European Commission is aware of that fact too .
At the beginning of this week a meeting was held in Bolivia between foreign ministers from the Latin American countries and their European Union counterparts .
The Cochabamba communiqué stressed the need for collective , concrete measures to tackle the worldwide drugs problem .
Commissioner Marín said at the meeting that the European Union had a different view from the United States on how to combat drug trafficking .
The Commission maintains that measures against drugs have in fact been unsuccessful so far .
Fortunately the European Commission is increasingly recognizing that there is a need to balance the fight against drugs with the general social and economic development of the drug-producing countries .
Ideally the European Union needs to appreciate that cooperation on measures to combat drugs should be born of broad cooperation on measures to foster a good civilian society in its partner countries .
That of course is a long job .
In short , Madam President , north-south cooperation and measures against drugs have failed in terms simply of a war on drugs .
The outcome is negative in two respects : the objectives pursued are not met and the effects of a heavy-handed policy are disastrous .
I think the Commission is on the right road with its proposal for a regulation .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , millions of people are addicted to drugs .
Cruel tragedies are taking place out of sight of our proposals , reports and amendments .
The victims are drug abusers , though not only them but also their families and all too often children and young people ; it is the latter who probably suffer the most in the vicinity of drugs .
A liberal policy is just as irresponsible as a passive one .
Cooperation must be increased , not only across borders but worldwide .
There must also be greater cooperation within countries , between social services , the police and schools and other educational establishments .
A dialogue has been initiated between the USA and Europe and it is obvious that Europe will have to do more if it is to be equal to the American challenges .
On this issue the committee has received a number of opinions from several other committees with relatively mixed results .
I am happy to see that the Committee on Development and Cooperation has succeeded in distilling a constructive and consistent line from so many contradictory standpoints .
It would be naive , however , to believe that the EU can replace all drugs with other crops and simply buy solutions to the problem .
This is unrealistic .
We can provide development aid , set a good example and contribute to development activities to create better infrastructure .
This is where progress in the area can be made .
The problems involved are massive and we cannot solve them through resignation ; rather we must counter them with greater efforts and endeavours .
We therefore expect the Intergovernmental Conference to find much more effective ways of taking decisions where drugs trafficking is concerned .
After all , we cannot then take a retrograde step in this connection .
The victims of drugs trafficking cannot simply be left to their fate .
We are all responsible , not least those Members of the Council who do not wish to meet the obligations imposed by the proposed measures but who do not have any alternative proposals either .
I welcome the humane viewpoint which I believe permeates both the proposal and the report .
It shows a way towards an alternative development which will result in less demand .
I am a grass-roots politician .
The Nord-Pas-de-Calais region , which I represent , has seen a considerable increase in this phenomenon during recent years .
Drug seizures increased by 272 % in 1995 as compared with the previous year .
The proportion of heroin addicts in the region is increasing ; it exceeds the national average by 15 % .
Multiple addiction is spreading .
It is the young generation that is affected : 90 % are under 30 and half are under 21 ; most of them are male and 65 % are job-seekers .
Every country or region that has tried this experiment has found it a failure and has turned back .
The Dutch also acknowledge that , although their policy has had satisfactory results over a long period , their liberal intentions are today being perverted by international traffickers .
What they have seen in the Netherlands is nothing less than drugs tourism , and they are the first victims of it .
In 1991 , 61 % of the heroin sold in France came from the Netherlands .
In the last two years , more than 40 people from the Department of Nord have died of an overdose in the Netherlands .
The French and Dutch police believe that young French people are making 200 trips per day to the Netherlands to buy drugs there .
An association from Lille , set up in 1995 , has set up a contact group in Rotterdam to repatriate these deeply distressed young people .
It is essential now to devise a plan for global action .
First , greater cooperation between the Member States is necessary to ensure better comprehension of mutual problems and the harmonization of policies .
We cannot organize the coexistence of such different models as those that exist at present .
Secondly , we need to reinforce the health programmes and information campaigns .
That is what we set out in the Burtone report .
Finally , we must boost international cooperation to combat organized crime and reduce supply .
It is crucial , then , to encourage substitution development strategies to offer certain developing countries other alternatives to the production of drugs .
The proposals by the Commission and the rapporteur are satisfactory .
We must allocate substantial resources to implementing them .
We shall therefore support this report , which is a step in the right direction .
Because people live in poverty , the result of the failure of large areas of our development cooperation , they often have no alternative .
One major element in our global policy on drugs is thus cooperation between north and south ; it has to be .
It is a useful means of strengthening the institutional capacity of the countries concerned so that they in turn can have the weapons with which to act against the laundering of drug money and fight the drug barons .
In another important aspect of our north-south cooperation , however , we must try to encourage the cultivation of alternative crops to get off the ground .
The funds for north-south cooperation are far too modest , Madam President . Ten million ECU is of course nothing , peanuts .
More must be found if Europe really wants to provide serious help with the problem we are discussing .
We must also cooperate with the United Nations and the Member States to make our efforts more effective .
My compliments to him .
There is no agreement , however , on how to reduce demand - and without the reduction of demand , the other measures will be largely ineffective .
Indeed , the eradication - or at least the attempted eradication - of drug crops from certain geographical areas has not resulted in the reduction of the quantity of those crops .
The question is not so simple - would that it were .
Madam President , plans drawn up around the conference table do no good .
One solution would be to involve local people from the outset in all restructuring plans for which aid is intended , but we can see few really positive examples of this .
The problem with international institutions receiving funds from the European Union is that the EU often loses any control .
Generally speaking , we are in favour of Mr Liese 's report .
But we fail to understand why he has suddenly developed such an admiration for trade preferences .
Basically , these benefit only large concerns , whereas small farmers gain absolutely nothing .
In Colombia , for example , in the flower plantations run by these large concerns , serious violations of human rights are taking place , particularly against female workers .
Their health is being damaged irresponsibly , and yet aid is being provided .
Is that what we want ?
Parliament has been demanding investigations for years now , but the Commission does nothing .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Madam Commissioner , not all the members in my group agree with the point I am about to make , so I shall speak personally .
The rapporteur proposes the development of alternative crops to persuade peasants in Third World countries to abandon the unlawful production of hallucinogenic plants .
The broad stratagem suggested is to offer customs preferences for the export of legal agricultural products .
In twenty years , the DEA has spent hundreds of millions of dollars a year to finance the destruction of thousands and thousands of hectares of illegal crops .
All this would be ludicrous , Madam President , if this whole drugs business were not totally tragic .
After twenty years , after thirty years of error , tragedy and evil effects of all kinds , there is not another minute to lose .
Individual States and the international community must be given back genuine control over the production and distribution of all the substances that are at present illegal .
We must regularize and legalize all drugs , straight away .
And let us stop telling the anti-prohibitionists that a debate on the legalization of drugs will be a waste of time .
Confronted with a disaster on this scale , it is the prohibitionists who must now bear the burden of proof .
Madam President , first of all I must compliment the rapporteur on the excellent report which he and the Committee on Development and Cooperation have produced .
Unlike the opinions delivered by other committees his report provides a balanced account and has avoided the temptation to make unduly forthright comments about liberalization and legalization .
Because that is not what we are about here .
The Commission 's aim with this proposal is to enable developing countries to combat drug addiction effectively and to involve them in existing international cooperation efforts on the subject .
Our job now is to examine this proposal from the point of view of development policy .
And that is what we must do .
And meanwhile the cultivation and sale of these crops also causes a lot of economic and social problems in their own countries too , which often have enough other problems as it is .
It is awful to realize that so far Europe has done precious little for the developing countries .
I also find it awful that some people are again trying to steer the debate towards liberalization and away from the real subject of this report .
We must not forget that the growing of narcotics is often the result of a deeper underlying problem , poverty .
We need to set up an international policy of cooperation with the developing world to combat the worldwide problem of drugs .
But this will lead nowhere unless we in Europe can offer these countries a real prospect of a better future .
Studies have shown that Europe has developed more in the direction of a closed market vis à vis the developing countries than an open market .
So I shall warmly endorse Amendment No 2 to Mr Liese 's report , which emphasizes this point .
I shall also support the other amendments which seek to channel aid as directly and as specifically as possible to where it is needed .
However , this report places a great deal of emphasis on economic aspects , and less on the power relationships underlying this problem .
But it is not just the credits that are modest .
I fear that the same applies to our actual intentions .
As things stand today , waging war on drugs means resulting to completely exceptional measures .
There are no signs at present that the European Union , or the Member States , intend to pursue this line .
For this reason , although the report is a good one , we once again feel that the heart of the matter has been overlooked .
That failure is derived from certain economic laws which apply also to the narcotics sector .
In the proposal under consideration the importance of the system of generalized preferences is confirmed .
The policies of crop destruction and the financing of alternative products are recognized by all studies and analyses as a failure .
It is essential therefore for the Commission to reconsider the scale of allocation of resources and it would be appropriate , moreover , to provide for rules with regard to co-financing .
Madam President , the production , marketing and consumption of drugs has increased beyond measure in the past few years .
As regards amphetamines , the total amount in 1990 was 380 kg seized as against 184 in 1989 .
The illegal trade in cannabis and marijuana is increasing throughout the world : in 1990 211 tonnes were seized as compared with 160 in 1989 and 242 in 1992 .
The drugs problem is world-wide .
Ladies and gentlemen , we must go to war against drugs in all spheres .
It is a true commitment requiring serious responses , an army of organized criminals cannot be beaten by the chatter of demagogues .
The road will be long , hard and not yet entirely sure , but free men who believe in life have the duty to travel it .
We are fully aware that the powers of the United Nations are very slight , but the road is worth travelling , in a framework of North-South financing in the drugs sector .
Madam President , the battle against drugs is a priority issue for the Commission .
The abuse of drugs is a great worry throughout the world .
Between 40 and 50 million people are addicted to illegal drugs .
In recent years the number of drug addicts has increased dramatically in developing countries too .
Within the EU there are hundreds of thousands of addicts .
This situation is extremely serious .
The Commission has a clear policy in this area . The emphasis is on efforts to reduce availability and demand , efforts to combat illegal trafficking and efforts involving international cooperation .
They must have the opportunity to earn an income from other crops .
It is a question of supporting countries ' own efforts , together with other international organisations . If the problem is to be dealt with effectively , efforts must be made in various quarters .
In concrete terms this means that the measures taken should be intended to reduce both supply and demand and to combat illegal trafficking and money laundering .
Amendment No 8 concerns the European Development Fund .
This is not a financing body belonging to the Community and it is not therefore possible to refer to other financing bodies in a legal act concerning budgetary matters .
Amendment No 15 refers to giving priority to direct measures to tackle the drug problem .
This would reduce the Commission 's freedom of action with regard to cooperation with developing countries to far too great an extent .
Amendment No 10 puts forward a limit of 10 % for , inter alia , the evaluation of projects .
The Commission considers that this could hinder the development of projects and that it would inappropriately restrict the opportunities for evaluation .
Amendment No 18 proposes a reference to Article 205 .
As the proposal concerns a legal act which will become Community law the whole Treaty must be respected . There is neither any need to confine oneself to a single article , nor would this be meaningful .
Amendment No 22 concerns comitology and the July 1987 decision of the Council . This issue can only be resolved within the framework of the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference .
Amendments Nos 23 and 25 concern reports to Parliament , to be made twice a year . The Commission 's proposal was for an annual report .
The Commission considers that Article 10 in its proposal meets the two legitimate demands that the Commission 's operations should be open to scrutiny and that it should concentrate on project administration .
Amendment No 27 concerns measures to combat illegal trafficking .
Amendment No 29 in part concerns the same issue as Amendment No 10 , i.e. a limit of 10 % , and also refers to studies and cooperation with specialised agencies .
I have already considered the issue of the 10 % limit and I would add that the Commission 's studies are generally carried out by experts .
It has proved extremely difficult to control such use .
Amendments Nos 2 , 8 and 12 can be approved by the Commission after some editorial changes which do not alter the substance .
The Commission can only accept parts of Amendments Nos 26 and 31 .
It is , nevertheless , of the opinion that the European Community cannot commit itself to not taking such measures . The Commission proposes that reference be made to the need to eliminate poverty in developing countries .
Amendment No 12 concerns protection against reprisals .
Bearing in mind the nature of the other measures which it usually supports , the Commission cannot commit itself to the protection of farmers from reprisals which drug traffickers may take .
Allow me in conclusion to stress the enormous importance which the Commission attaches to cooperation with developing countries in the fight against drug abuse .
We welcome the European Parliament 's considerable commitment to the issue .
Thank you , Mrs Gradin .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m .
Civil protection action programme
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is the international decade for the prevention of natural disasters , which will end in the year 2000 .
In 1994 , there were 580 natural disasters across the world , causing 16 000 deaths and more than USD 65 million worth of material losses .
And I believe that the Chernobyl disaster makes crystal clear the vital need for Europe-wide civil protection measures .
In 1985 , a first ministerial meeting laid the foundations for Community cooperation in the field of civil protection .
And since 1984 , the European Parliament has delivered a number of opinions in favour of the introduction of more effective measures , especially in the field of prevention .
Fundamental to this proposal are measures in the areas of forecasting , prevention , training and information , the self-protection , awareness and solidarity of citizens , and cooperation and coordination between local , regional and national authorities .
The role of the non-governmental organizations and the need for adequate funding are the subject of other amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment .
Such a committee is clearly provided for in Article 4 of the proposal , and we believe that consultation and the requirement that the Commission must take its views into account are sufficient .
Finally , in the explanatory statement , we strongly recommend that a European Union intervention fund should be set up to guarantee immediate and effective action in the case of disasters .
Having an intervention fund would be an important means of ensuring a more rapid and effective response .
I am therefore proposing that the Intergovernmental Conference should address this issue , and I thank Mrs González Álvarez for her comments concerning my amendment .
Having said that , it is true that something is better than nothing .
I should like to end , Madam President , by congratulating Mrs González Álvarez once again , although I fear that the Union 's citizens would have preferred a more ambitious and specific text .
The Commission proposal now before us adopts the right approach , setting out an integrated action programme which complements existing Community activities in the field of civil protection .
What does this involve ?
EU involvement should therefore be restricted to additional help in cases where there is a need for cross-border action .
In short , it is a matter of transferring know-how , providing mutual assistance and exchanging experiences .
This was the thinking behind the existing activities , and in my opinion it should be maintained in principle .
In the past , there has always been a good deal of interest in the transfer of know-how .
I also welcome the proposed new measures to improve the ability of European citizens to protect themselves against risks , however , since this should help considerably to restrict or reduce the damage caused by disasters .
Opinions differ , however , as to how the future action programme should be implemented , especially in terms of who should take the final decision on the measures to be carried out .
The new civil protection committee , consisting as before of Member States ' representatives , would have a purely advisory role .
Its members would merely be informed whether or not the Commission was following their recommendations .
I find this unacceptable .
I fully realize that the European Parliament has its own , critical attitude to the question of comitology , and quite rightly so in many cases .
I am not seeking blindly to hand over all decision-making power to the Council and take away responsibility from the Commission and Parliament .
Rather , it is our duty to devise appropriate Community procedures for an area of activity which is on the extreme fringes of Community competence .
I could only support a solution on the Commission 's lines if civil protection were to be included in the Treaty in its own right .
No such passage will be inserted into the Treaty , and we must therefore make the necessary changes .
Let us be consistent and remain within the framework which we ourselves have adopted as a guide , and let us at least apply the rules of comitology .
Madam President , I welcome the proposed action programme on civil protection .
It has been a long time coming - probably because the Treaty as we have already heard does not provide specific powers to act in this area .
The programme had to be put forward under the general Article 235 .
We can only hope it will not suffer the blocking fate of the poverty programme and the Action for the Elderly programme which are under this legal base .
I am proud to support the London Fire Service , the largest and probably the best in the world .
Disasters are happening all over the world .
The proposal also provides a legal basis for budget item B4-3300 concerning civil protection and environmental disasters .
With that , permit me to move on to the amendments which have been tabled , Madam President . The Commission accepts many of the proposals .
Amendments Nos 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 and 19 improve and clarify the text and elaborate the Commission 's proposal .
The Commission approves them in their entirety or substance .
Certain amendments cannot be approved by the Commission , however .
We believe that the Commission 's proposal concerning comitology provides the best balance between the institutions , as a result of which Amendments Nos 16 , 17 , 18 , 27 , 28 and 30 cannot be approved .
What the Commission is proposing is in fact a committee procedure of type 1 . Changing to a different procedure would mean a less effective decision-making process .
Amendment No 25 would allow voluntary organisations to obtain support from the Community for their work .
Voluntary organisations are not authorities and cannot therefore be approved .
We should , however , remember that non-profitmaking organisations play a very important role in civil protection in our Member States .
We have every reason , therefore , to encourage them in their work .
In Amendment No 26 it is proposed that the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference should provide civil protection with a special legal basis .
A programme of measures is , however , not the right place to establish views on what the Intergovernmental Conference should result in and we cannot therefore accept the amendment .
As a result of the amendments tabled the proposal concerning civil protection has , I believe , been much improved .
This situation will present considerable problems .
The Commission cannot therefore support activities of the kind involved in the three simulation exercises to be conducted this year in Italy and Sweden and on the Dutch-German border .
The same applies with regard to the European Fire Services Training College 's summer course in fire and rescue work .
The situation can be improved , however , if Parliament approves without delay the request for the transfer of appropriations to the budget item for civil protection which the Commission intends to submit in the very near future .
Thank you , Mrs Gradin .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m .
( The sitting was closed at 7.45 p.m. )
I understand from a well-intentioned leak that today is the birthday of the chairman of the PPE .
I will take this opportunity to offer him , on your behalf , our very best wishes .
Thank you for your good wishes , and thank you all for your kind thoughts .
Many thanks .
Madam President , I would like to draw attention to a somewhat regrettable misunderstanding which occurred yesterday .
And in drawing attention to it , I hope that something or other may be done so that it does not occur again .
I had a group of visitors who were sitting up in the gallery , and I was going to show them around Parliament .
In the meantime the Danish head of the visitors ' service had been summoned .
That means that the group were given the impression that I had not been here , that I was not doing my job , and that I could not be got hold of .
The long and the short of it is that I was not able to show the group around Parliament at all , but only found them five minutes before they were due to leave the place .
I would , at any event , like to be assured that such a thing does not happen again .
One might be waiting for some very important messages sitting here in the Chamber .
Mrs Sandbæk , I have read about this incident and the misunderstanding that occurred .
Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
As regards the resolution on Tibet , my name does not appear although I did vote in favour , by roll-call vote .
That error will be corrected , Mr Caudron .
Are there any other comments ?
( Parliament approves the Minutes )
Madam President , this morning I was presented with a hotel bill for the week of this session , and the price was almost 25 % higher than in March .
I have heard that all the hotels in Strasbourg have introduced this special price for the weeks when Parliament is in session .
Would the Bureau please try to persuade the competent authorities to break this price cartel and , if necessary , impose fines on those concerned .
As an immediate measure , I would suggest that during those weeks when we meet in Strasbourg , we should not meet here in the Palais but at the Espace Leopold building instead .
By so doing we shall show that we are not prepared to be held hostage by these people who are forcing prices up .
Mrs Gebhardt , that was not a point of order , but as you can imagine I was listening very attentively .
Votes
I voted against the González Álvarez report , in the first place because I do not subscribe to the proposals it contains .
In the amendments attention is called in particular to the ultraperipheral regions of the Union .
I see no good reason why this primarily requires European interference .
But what is more important is that I am against the Commission proposal as such .
The proposal is based on Article 235 of the Treaty , the article which provides a legal basis for actions unconnected with the objectives of the Treaty .
My Group thinks that civil protection is an activity which the Member States can well handle for themselves .
Even more important , very often protection of the population is in the hands of large numbers of volunteers .
That alone indicates that one must be careful about European interference .
Why should the EU intervene in fields which are now looked after with great dedication by the Member States themselves ?
Cases are conceivable in which the European Union may play a useful part .
Crossborder disasters for example . They of course require a cross-border approach , that is logical .
The prevention of natural disasters by a responsible management of nature and the environment may also justify the European approach .
But that is not this programme 's primary aim .
This programme is much too broad and general and I am therefore against it .
This statement contains no approach or analysis of the great variety of the different types of risk of extraordinary seriousness to which our countries and regions are subjected .
We all know what they are and we have suffered the harmful effects of many of them .
Costa Neves report
These are problems whose importance cannot be too highly estimated , namely the TACIS regulation concerning the States of the former Soviet Union and Mongolia .
We are of the opinion that , because of these various procedural shortcomings , it would have been entirely possible , on our side as well , to have dealt with the matter at greater length .
This fresh start , however , is once again gravely at risk .
Consequently , in our amendments we have laid special emphasis on one specific area .
I am particularly happy about the fact that in committee there was a large majority in favour of two amendments which I believe are of particular significance .
In other words , these countries are , to an increasing extent , becoming donor countries too .
I think that it is very important to encourage and intensify this process .
These countries will thus be acting as bridges .
Therefore this report has been deliberately arranged along regionalistic lines .
Madam President , the problem with the Tacis regulation is not a new one .
We have examined this problem and made a start on tackling it , and I hope that this time we shall be more successful .
The problem lies with the Council of Ministers .
A further difficulty will lie in the fact that these are Western advisers , with the result that Russian , Mongolian or Kalmuk advisers will not be taken into consideration at all .
There is an enormous problem here .
However , we as a Parliament must of course attempt to do something about it .
However , I have a problem with his argument that we should simply use the traditional structures .
We should like to offer this option to those people who live in traditional structures , but we also want to encourage the new , emancipating , democratic structures that are also developing in these countries .
Madam President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Pex , for his excellent report .
For reasons that are well known to us , the restructuring process in these countries is taking very much longer than expected ; certainly it is being obstructed often enough .
It is particularly important to give the people a new feeling of self-worth and of confidence in their own capabilities .
There is no doubt that , in future , the aid should be accompanied by more critical comment , and this is a task for the Commission in particular .
It remains to be seen , however , how this can be achieved in practice .
It also seems to me rather important that there should now be some coordination in bilateral aid schemes between different countries , where those aid schemes have the same intentions and development areas .
This has happened all too rarely in the past , but it is very useful as a means of pooling resources and avoiding duplication of effort .
I am very pleased about the passage in the Council 's draft which lays down that it should not always be the same experts who are involved .
Mr Elchlepp , I believe this is the first time you have spoken in this House .
Please , therefore , accept my warmest congratulations .
Madam President , on behalf of the Commission I would first like to thank Parliament for the fact that the Members agreed to deal with this topic under urgent procedure .
Parliament has been of considerable assistance in ensuring that this reconsultation proceeds rapidly and constructively .
I would especially like to express my gratitude for the speed with which the report has been drawn up .
As you all know , the period of validity of the previous Tacis regulation expired at the end of 1995 .
Since then the Commission has been forced to operate in a legal vacuum .
The vote today is therefore an important step towards a stable framework for our medium-term planning .
It will also enable us to implement the programme for 1996 .
The Commission submitted an initial proposal for a new Tacis regulation as early as April 1995 .
Parliament delivered its opinion on it in time , in November 1995 . The Council , however , modified the proposal in respect of a number of crucial points .
The Commission therefore considered that it was necessary for Parliament to be consulted again .
To summarise the Council 's new proposal briefly , it can be said that some of the ideas which Parliament put forward in its opinion in November 1995 have already been incorporated .
For example , the proposal gives greater priority to the environment , permits combined financing through Interreg and Tacis and provides for the regulation to have a limited period of validity .
Other important changes include the conditions relating to contracting procedures and the conditions for the implementation of the programme .
The Commission is able to accept these amendments because they entail a reasonable institutional balance while at the same time maintaining the conditions for the effective administration of the Tacis programme .
The new text will also improve the necessary openness of the programme .
Most of the new provisions are intended to formalise the procedures which have been applied up to now .
The Commission considers it a positive step that these are now being given a more formal basis .
Both these changes are in response to repeated requests from recipients . They also meet other objectives which are clearly in the interests of the European Union .
Financing through the provision of capital will make it possible through Tacis to promote industrial cooperation between small and medium-sized businesses in the EU and their counterparts in the NIS .
It is important to give Tacis the opportunity to finance small-scale investment in infrastructure .
One of the aims of cross-border cooperation is after all to remove bottlenecks at frontiers , to increase trade and transport across borders .
It is also a question of fostering cross-border cooperation between the EU and the NIS and between countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the NIS .
The new regulation means that political conditions may be attached to aid .
Consequently , respect for human rights and democratic principles has been given a more prominent place in the new regulation .
The Commission accepts by far the largest proportion of the amendments tabled by Parliament .
I understand that you would like to retain the possibility of resources being earmarked for technical assistance on the one hand and infrastructure and capital provision on the other .
We also find it difficult to approve certain proposals in connection with open tendering procedures as this would extend the implementation of the programme still further .
As regards institutional aspects , the Commission believes that the retention of a management committee in the proposal would be a good compromise between the position of Parliament and that of the Council .
Madam President , in sum we have every reason to be satisfied with the results of our joint efforts .
This is especially crucial for Russia , which is approaching important crossroads .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed with the vote .
Madam President , a slight error has crept in .
In committee , Ms Schroedter used the expression ' indigenous peoples ' , which I continued to use .
The original text was in German , but it has now been translated into other languages , and the expression ' native peoples ' has been used .
In German , however , this expression has unfortunate overtones , although as far as content is concerned it means something similar .
I entirely share that sentiment , and we will endeavour to find the most appropriate way .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
I wonder whether the Commission is able to make its statement now .
A while ago , when voting began there were nearly 200 of us here .
Now there are about 40 .
Mr Fabre-Aubrespy , I think that , as this statement is so important , Members will remain until this matter comes up in the order of business .
It would not be polite to those Members whose reports are to be considered first to change the order of business , and I must refuse to do so .
If any one else raises a similar point , I can tell you quite simply that I shall not be able to act on it .
We will therefore adhere to the order of business .
Interim agreement with Kazakhstan
This text is very important for Kazakhstan , which has suffered from the breakup of the former Soviet Union , with severe damage to its trading system and its supply network .
The economic and commercial aspects relate to trade in goods subject to mostfavoured-nation treatment .
Coal and steel occupy an important place in this partnership agreement , while trade in textile products is the subject of a separate agreement .
The provisions affecting business and investment govern the field of employment as well as the establishment and operation of companies .
Economic cooperation extends to the industrial sector , the promotion and protection of investments , and the strengthening of education and training in the widest possible range of areas .
Further elections took place on 5 and 9 December 1995 .
The delegation of European Parliament observers deemed that these elections were such as to form the basis for the formation of a democratic parliament .
Madam President , the partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan was in fact signed on 23 January 1995 .
The first stage relates to this interim agreement which we are to approve today , although Parliament 's opinion on the matter is of only very limited relevance .
The Committee on Foreign Affairs considers that we should give a favourable opinion , and that is my personal opinion also .
The economic issues are important , and it would not be appropriate to delay the cooperation envisaged in the interim agreement .
However , this opinion will be without prejudice to the final position we adopt on the main agreement , that is to say the partnership agreement itself .
The facts are that the economic situation in Kazakhstan is still poor , the social situation is serious , or even tragic , and above all the political situation has once again become tense just recently .
Human rights are not respected , and President Nazarbaev seems almost insensitive to Western criticism .
But we shall see what we shall see .
For the present , the Committee on Foreign Affairs shares the point of view of the Committee on External Economic Relations and approves the interim agreement .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the agreement with Kazakhstan is often discussed purely from an economic viewpoint .
In fact , Kazakhstan is a country that one might almost describe as explosive .
Moreover , there is no doubt that the most dynamic countries have already become interested in the country .
It is therefore of very great importance to the Community that we should set an example as far as Kazakhstan is concerned .
I admit that there are endless problems : social problems , employment problems and , last but not least , a relatively weak democracy .
As far as President Nazarbaev himself is concerned , he has been very strongly criticised .
However , I should just like to say one thing : the man is , after all , a Turk .
Recent events in particular have shown us that we must be careful here , and that in consequence a sign from us to President Nasarbajev would be of great political advantage to political stability in Central Asia .
Madam President , may I take this opportunity to wish Mr Martens many happy returns of his birthday today .
But now about Kazakhstan .
If you look at European interests in Kazakhstan , they are naturally not insignificant .
We rather like the idea of the reserves of oil and gas there and large-scale European undertakings are already busy making sure that they have the opportunity to exploit them .
Finally in Kazakhstan we also have Philip Morris , who has taken over the cigarette industry .
Finally I should like to say something about energy , because the interim agreement too touches upon nuclear safety .
I would rather see social security in Kazakhstan put before our trade and economy .
The report is to be welcomed , because the current economic situation in Kazakhstan , as has already been mentioned several times , must be regarded as very bad to catastrophic .
Mr von Habsburg has just given a very graphic description of the situation , particularly with regard to fundamentalism .
This will only be possible , however , if there is a comprehensive economic stabilization of the country , particularly by reducing the rate of inflation .
Otherwise , the creation of added value , and with it long-term economic recovery , will be almost impossible .
If the agreement is to be of benefit to both sides , the interim agreement must be accompanied by macroeconomic aid measures .
In any case , however , Kazakhstan must be willing to make the effort itself .
Where there is political uncertainty , one can more or less rule out any hope of foreign investors committing themselves to any great extent .
So even the planned privatization of formerly state-owned undertakings would only be successful if this political climate were stabilized .
Madam President , the Interim Agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan makes it possible for us rapidly to put into practice the intentions of the partnership and cooperation agreement on trade and trade-related issues .
It constitutes a general framework for our future relations with these countries .
I would particularly like to thank Mr Chesa for an excellent report .
My colleague , Commissioner Van den Broek , has recently visited Alma-Ata and Tashkent and studied the situation in Kazakhstan .
Various signals emerged from discussions with the Kazakh authorities .
The level of priority accorded by Kazakhstan to relations with the European Union is extremely unclear .
All the participants stressed that Kazakhstan 's absolute priority is to strengthen relations with Russia .
However , it remains unclear whether strengthening relations with the Union , with us in other words , is as important as those with China , the USA and Japan .
The Kazakhstan government assured the Commission that , despite the agreement , Kazakhstan considered itself to be free to determine for itself the content and conditions of its relations with third countries .
It remains to be seen whether this will be possible as regards trade .
Customs union agreements , for example , prescribe the automatic acceptance of Russia 's customs tariffs and customs legislation .
The ambassadors of the Member States of the EU in Alma-Ata have noted that the European companies which are represented in the country are hesitant about investment .
They have adopted a ' wait and see ' attitude on account of the uncertainty surrounding Kazakhstan 's political structure .
Although certain companies have moved to Tashkent in Uzbekistan , there has not as yet been any large-scale withdrawal from Alma-Ata .
The European Union regards as essential regional cooperation and voluntary integration with respect for the independence and sovereignty of each participating country .
The Kazakhs appear to be open to the idea of establishing communications to the West , to Europe , through the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus .
In political terms this would be an attractive way of complementing the country 's priority orientation to Russia .
Tacis is supporting projects such as transport corridors in the Caucasus and Central Asia and the working party for oil and glass management .
It is too soon to draw conclusions about how and at what speed relations with the European Union will develop in the future .
In view of the country 's geopolitical interests and its wealth of natural resources , the European Union should follow political developments in Kazakhstan closely .
The Interim Agreement provides the appropriate basis for the promotion of such a development .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed with the vote .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Cooperation Agreement with Nepal
Madam President , as you have just mentioned , this is a question of deciding to ratify the first , and therefore historic , economic and trade cooperation agreement between the European Union and Nepal .
This agreement , as one may easily imagine , represents hope for this little Himalayan country .
Since 1990 Nepal has been engaged in a radical institutional change which has led to free multi-party elections and the alternation of democratic governments .
I hope the Commission will take up this suggestion and I am sure that the European Parliament , in approving the budget , will support this request .
I must stress that the draft agreement submitted for our approval has the same features as those already concluded by the European Union with other developing countries .
I wish to point out the importance of the so-called human rights clause in the agreement , which is a positive and characteristic feature .
It is also a fact , moreover , that the Government of Nepal has unequivocally committed itself to promoting and guaranteeing total respect for human rights in the country .
From an economic and commercial point of view it is vital for the aims laid down in the agreement to be achieved as soon as possible .
It must in fact be stressed that Nepal has an extremely adverse balance of trade .
Its total imports amounted in 1992 to 780 million dollars , whilst export earnings were the equivalent of only 350 million dollars .
The Kingdom of Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world and therefore has to face difficult challenges in the field of development .
We are dealing , as I said , with a young democracy , still fragile , seeking unconditional support in order to be able to consolidate definitively its own process of democratic transition .
I therefore recommend Parliament to proceed without delay to ratify this economic and trade cooperation agreement .
Madam President , I congratulate Mr Pettinari on the quality of his report .
Respect for human rights is an important element in the draft before us .
Indeed , it is actually the subject of the first article of that draft .
Well , Nepal is not entirely above criticism in this matter .
The police still use methods which could be described as dubious , to say the least .
We are now being invited to open the way to stable , sustainable development in Nepal , accompanied by respect for human rights .
However , it should be noted that the Committee on Budgets has expressed several important criticisms regarding the conclusion of this agreement perhaps because of the absence of the financial statement , although one was appended to the agreement .
Madam President , this is the first cooperation agreement between the European Union and Nepal and as such it is a landmark in our relations .
I welcome it most warmly as vice-chair of the South-Asian delegation .
I deplore that it has taken four months to bring to plenary because of an internal dispute in Parliament .
We must sort this sort of thing out much more quickly in future .
Nepal has made great strides in developing a pluralistic , democratic system of government in the last few years .
It is to be complimented on this .
One way to tackle this is to improve education for women and alleviate rural poverty .
This agreement can help in doing this .
As Katmandu is host to the secretariat of SAARC . I endorse the rapporteur 's request that the Commission put a full representative in there as soon as possible .
I regret the unenthusiastic opinion from the Committee on Budgets which might have been avoided if the Commission had put forward a more rigorous financial statement as part of the agreement .
In that context I wholeheartedly commend the agreement to the House .
Madam President , the Group of the European People 's Party welcomes the fact that we have now , as the previous speaker mentioned , finally achieved this cooperation agreement with Nepal .
I should therefore like to ask the Commission to give special attention to this sector .
From that point of view we have got a good start here .
Of course Nepal still has a problem with child labour , but the country has made some progress .
We cannot change conditions by this demand alone , but somewhere here there has to be some kind of quid pro quo as well ; that much is obvious , of course .
Several speakers have referred to the fact that the per capita income is extremely low in this country , and child labour is a sign of this , and must be considered accordingly .
The other problem , forced prostitution , is also a matter of common knowledge .
I very much support the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , including on the question of human rights .
The issue of imprisonment for debt is certainly a problem which is rooted in the country and its history .
At the end of the day , we cannot free a country from its history , which to some extent may have taken a very different course from that of our own .
Madam President , I thank Mr Pettinari for this excellent report .
Nepal is very high up and helping this country where needs are very great must also be high up on our list .
Madam President , the Union has hardly any links with Nepal except tourism , but no contractual relationship at all .
It is one of the poorest countries where the average income is no more than 180 to 200 dollars .
For that you can make one visit to a hotel here in Strasbourg .
It offers the opportunity for strengthening trade and investments , for economic and technical cooperation and provides an ideal forum for regular discussion in the joint parliamentary committee .
We must have a presence there just when the process of democratization is beginning to bear fruit .
Nepal is chiefly dependent for its income on tourists , but we must not let them spoil whatever remains of a good environment .
The Union , Madam President , is Nepal 's foremost trading partner .
We shall therefore naturally vote for the cooperation agreement .
I myself have visited the country several times , and I have seen the problems for myself , at first hand , problems which also affect those areas that lie at a higher altitude .
This reafforestation programme was given a very positive reception .
I believe that the European Union quite simply has a duty to help this small Asiatic state .
Therefore I welcome the fact that this agreement has given rise to the present debate , and I believe that in future the Union will have to take further important decisions on this subject .
It is the first treaty between the European Union and a third country which is based on respect for and observance of human rights .
If human rights are not respected , the treaty can be suspended .
Like Anita Pollack , I welcome this , as the Deputy Vice-President of the European Parliament 's SAARC Group .
I am delighted that we are able to debate this agreement here today , in the presence of the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Nepal to the EU .
They have now laid the foundations , and I am delighted that we are able to build on these foundations together .
We also want to provide incentives for direct investment in Nepal .
We want to encourage business links with European SMEs ( small and medium-sized enterprises ) , to give long-term support to economic development , and to guarantee better market access for Nepalese products .
Namaste !
Madam President , the first bilateral agreement between the Community and Nepal will surely help improve relations between the Community and the Himalayan kingdom as regards politics , trade and cooperation .
This agreement represents a further demonstration of the importance of Asia to the Community in its efforts to develop foreign relations .
The summit which took place recently in Bangkok was another milestone .
Cooperation agreements with Bangladesh , Cambodia , Laos and Pakistan are also under discussion .
The Nepal agreement comes at a time when the country is undergoing a process of democratisation , where respect for human rights continues to be a major challenge .
The political dialogue gives us the opportunity to stress the importance of human rights and democratic principles , which of course also includes the question of child labour .
The joint parliamentary committee is responsible for dialogue on cooperation and for trade and investment issues .
It is hoped that the first meeting of the joint parliamentary committee will be held in Katmandu in September or October 1996 .
My colleague , Commissioner Marín , is also planning a visit to Nepal and will of course have the opportunity there to talk with the Nepalese leaders .
Naturally , it will only be at the meeting of the joint parliamentary committee that there will be an opportunity to delimit and define certain of the priorities which need to be established .
I should , however , like to mention the following possibilities for cooperation :
Finally , I should like to thank Mr Pettinari for an excellent report .
The present proposal by the Commission is intended to introduce measures to restrict the rape cultivation in question if this figure of 1 million tonnes of soya bean meal equivalents is exceeded .
Depending on how you calculate it , this quantity is equivalent to a cultivation area of about 1.2 million hectares of rape , a figure which so far has never been reached in the European Union .
This scheme has no effect on expenditure from the European budget . However , in 1995 the amount produced was 940 tonnes , which fell well short of the maximum permitted quantity of 1 million tonnes .
Many by-products can however be used for other purposes .
This means that our farmers have the chance of developing this alternative fuel on a larger scale , if they are able to grow an unlimited quantity of rape on their set-aside land .
The reason for this is that the change in the range of oilseed varieties in recent years has resulted in a reduction in the crude protein / fat content .
Amendment No 2 takes these recent developments into account by setting lower coefficients which are legally binding .
The coefficients proposed by the EDN are of course better from the mathematical point of view , but in practical terms they are not really enforceable at the present time .
Nevertheless , we suggest that these coefficients should be reviewed every year and adjusted under the management committee procedure .
He has put together what we believe is an excellent report .
Set-aside is a very unpopular regime both with farmers and the general public .
We want to keep flexible at all stages . That is one of the reasons why we will , in our voting , make sure that we reflect the need for flexibility .
I am a Member from Great Britain , as you know . I cannot stand up in the Chamber now without saying something about the crisis in agriculture in Britain at the moment .
I would like your indulgence while I very briefly tell you some of the things that are happening .
In this field , Austria has had very good experience over a long period .
In our country we have used energy plants not only for heating , but also as lubricants or as methyl ester obtained from rape , and we have really been most successful with it .
I believe that we owe it to future generations to have a change of attitude on this subject .
The principle of using oil seeds for non-food purposes is simple .
The regulations in force provide for the set-aside of some agricultural land .
However , the use of that land to produce oil seeds for non-food purposes is authorized .
The only problem is that not all the oil seeds can be converted to non-food purposes .
The Commission is taking account of this constraint , and the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture are mitigating its effects .
I shall therefore not go into the matter in any further detail , but will use my two minutes to give my views on set aside as a whole .
But , of course , in order to make the calculations it is necessary to know the conversion coefficient for each production .
I should like to hear from the Commission what the situation is with regard to that proposal . The Commission wants to encourage the use of these products .
Mr President , Mr Goepel and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have together produced a constructive report , on which I congratulate them .
The Commission 's proposal is aimed at maximising the opportunities for farmers in the European Union to cultivate the oilseeds covered by the Memorandum of Understanding , while at the same time respecting our international obligations in full .
Amendment No 1 proposes that the threshold of 1 million tonnes should apply only to byproducts used in foodstuffs and animal feed .
The Commission accepts this amendment .
Thank you , Mrs Gradin .
The Group came to a number of very important conclusions which the Commission was particularly pleased to note .
The second major point they made was that in order to attain our objective , we need to ensure strong economic growth and structural reform , which requires a well-balanced mix of macroeconomic and employment policies .
They all acknowledged the need to pursue vigorously open trading policies and called on Trade Ministers to maintain the momentum of trade liberalization through the World Trade Organization and at its conference in Singapore .
Mr President , the Socialist Group supports every real - and I stress , real - initiative to deal with the problem of unemployment .
To the extent that the French presidency 's initiative for Lille can be considered real , it certainly has our support .
To the extent that it constitutes a continuation and perpetuation of pre-election , vote-campaigning rhetoric on unemployment , we are obliged to stress that the problem of unemployment is far too serious to be dealt with by rhetoric alone .
Where unemployment is concerned , the time for seminars is past .
It is true that among G7 some economies achieve lower unemployment levels than others .
On the contrary .
Those are fine words , but what is to happen in practice ?
We expect something more from the meeting of the G7 leaders . We need measures , not just discussions .
The G7 leaders disassociated their position from the theory that development can continue within a framework of unemployment .
The statement stresses that more rapid development is a basic prerequisite for fighting unemployment . We agree .
Development at a rate higher than at present is certainly a prerequisite for the absorption of any significant proportion of unemployment .
Nowadays , economic growth alone is not sufficient to reduce unemployment . The natural level of unemployment , and with it the numbers of long-term unemployed , increases with every recession .
My idea is that if it does not come from the Union it will not get on to the agenda in the right way .
The Union has a social model to protect and to lose .
Mr President , I must say that words fail me - and that is something that does not , I think , happen to me very often .
I must say that that takes a lot of swallowing ! Mrs Gradin , why are the Commission and the Community not taking action to ensure that the subject is discussed at the United Nations Economic and Social Council ?
Will the Commission finally decide where it stands in this debate ?
Instead of protecting us , therefore , the policy of Brussels would become the implicit ally of those opposed to our societies , our ways of life and our nations .
The answer most frequently given to this serious accusation is that the best way in which the European States can defend themselves is to improve their competitiveness .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am also speaking for Mr Schreiner . The statements that have been made today admittedly make clear the Commission 's firm intention to make employment a central theme of its work .
Practical measures are lacking , however , and platitudes remain ineffectual .
The same applies to savings programmes without simultaneous structural reform .
We shall not create jobs by adopting regulations and declarations of intent .
Jobs will only be created by competitive framework conditions and , as a result , optimistic investors who are willing to take a risk , and not by the whingeing of affluent citizens .
I ask the Commission : how can we cope with this ? Surely we cannot turn the clock backwards .
Society must continue to move forward and progress . Every citizen in Europe wants to see this happening .
Every effort has to be made to achieve development but , unfortunately , this approach is being resisted . It is being resisted by environmentalists .
I do not want to suggest that we should not consider environmental issues - of course we should .
But everybody seems to want to resist and oppose development and efforts to get things done .
So I want to ask the Commission : is there a way , can you reconcile these differences ?
Is the Commission looking at this side of the argument at all .
Mr President , thank you for all the interesting contributions and comments on my report from the G7 meeting .
Thank you , Commissioner .
Adjournment of the session
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 19 April 1996 .
Tribute
Ladies and gentlemen , it is my sad duty to inform you of the death of Mr Robert Hersant on 21 April 1996 .
Mr Hersant was chairman of the Robert Hersant press group .
From 1956 to 1978 he was a member of the French National Assembly .
In the direct elections of 1984 , 1989 and 1994 Mr Hersant was elected to the European Parliament and was a member of the Group of the European People 's Party in this House .
He was a member of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment .
Our sympathy goes to his family , his parliamentary group and all his friends .
I now ask you to rise for one minute to honour his memory .
( Parliament rose and observed one minute 's silence )
Mr President , I wish to raise a point of order under Rule 102 ( 2 ) .
As an English speaker , I condemn this discourtesy to other Members of Parliament .
It is very discriminatory that they should be forced to present their views in a foreign language .
The committee views this with the greatest concern .
All speakers in this Parliament are entitled to speak in their mother tongue whether that language is spoken by many or by few .
This Parliament should know about this and if you ask why is he doing this , it is because of the beef crisis .
He is trying to make Europe the scapegoat for his own inadequacies in representing the Scottish beef industry .
However , I am glad to tell the House that local authorities right across Scotland will be flying the flag in defiance of that ban .
I suspect he has sent these officials over here to fly the flag .
Gentlemen , let us call a halt to this debate .
I can assure you that the European Parliament will not be influenced by the comments of the British Secretary of State for Scotland .
I think this is an infringement of the Rules of Procedure , though probably not intentional .
To be clear I should like to say that the question I have in mind is No 14975 of 10 November 1995 .
I shall look into that , Mr Florio .
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen , 46 years ago tomorrow , on 9 May 1950 , Robert Schuman , who was then the French Foreign Minister , made a historic declaration .
On the basis of that declaration the European Communities were then founded and subsequently developed into today 's European Union .
Each of you has written an outstanding essay on the subject ' Europe as I know it today and the Europe in which I want to live tomorrow ' .
I should like to offer my sincere congratulations on your excellent achievement and to express the hope that you are spending an interesting and thought-provoking day here in the European Parliament .
( Applause )
Urgent political matters
The next item is the statement by the Commission on urgent political matters of major importance .
I call Mr Fischler , Member of the Commission .
I wish to confine my report to the developments that have taken place since my previous report to the House .
Let me highlight especially the conclusions adopted by the Council of Agricultural Ministers on 29 and 30 April .
Secondly , the Commission , in collaboration with the Member States , carried out an inspection visit to the United Kingdom from 22 to 24 April 1996 .
Thirdly , the United Kingdom has submitted an additional programme of selective slaughter .
These talks in the Standing Veterinary Committee are taking place this very day .
The main issue there is how to include in the selective programme those herds in which numerous cases of BSE have occurred .
Finally , much of the discussion focused on the fact that we ought to rethink the existing Commission procedure for obtaining scientific advice .
These conditions were decided upon by the Commission this morning , and I have undertaken to submit to the next meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee a Commission proposal for the committee to discuss .
I have undertaken to table a proposal on this matter for the next meeting of the Council .
In this same context it will be very important for us first and foremost to take due account of the expectations that consumers will have of the meat they buy in future .
Ladies and gentlemen , the BSE crisis has triggered off a massive loss of consumer confidence as well as spelling real disaster for producers throughout Europe .
We have no alternative ; we must overcome this problem together .
We need Britain 's solidarity in order to ensure that the measures decided upon and those yet to be adopted will be given the utmost priority and will be properly implemented .
This means that the gradual lifting of the export ban is very much linked to the efforts undertaken by Britain and the way these efforts are put into effect .
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen , it gives me great pleasure to welcome to the gallery today the Speaker of the Polish Senate , Mr Adam Struzik , and his parliamentary colleagues .
We bid you a warm welcome .
Urgent political matters ( continuation )
Mr President , thank you very much for looking in this direction .
Commissioner , you have spoken again about solidarity , and I agree with you .
However , the demands you made of the British Government in your appeal for solidarity have not yet been met .
Are you aware of any herds with a history of BSE having actually been slaughtered ?
Are you able to check on how the additional programme that was announced is working , or do you know how it is supposed to work and whether it has been set in motion at all ?
I do understand your intention to start by lifting the embargo on gelatine , which is perhaps the least dangerous by-product , but here too there are risks involved .
Do you not share my view that this is a signal to the public , implying that something has actually happened ?
I maintain that since this embargo was imposed absolutely nothing has been done in England .
But these measures that have now been announced and this gradual lifting of the ban will be seen as an indication that action has been taken .
That is no way to restore confidence !
I should like to deal with the honourable Member 's question .
First of all , I mentioned in my report that the Commission had carried out an inspection visit to Britain , in which the Member States also had the opportunity to take part .
Farms were inspected , not only in England but throughout the United Kingdom , and the inspection team was able to form a picture of the progress made in implementing the various measures .
It is not true that nothing has been done in England .
On the contrary , appropriate efforts have been made there , although the report does say that these efforts have not always been sufficient .
So this means that the measures have to be further intensified .
The third aspect of this issue is surely the question of labelling and of the carcass-processing industry and the safety of its processes .
As far as gelatine and tallow are concerned , we cannot simply regard these as being on a par with meat .
In this area clear recommendations have been made by the World Health Organization and the Standing Veterinary Committee .
This is the scientific basis on which all our actions are founded , and the key message is that safe procedures must be our foremost priority .
I have also said already that this precept is being applied to the conditions that have to be met in the United Kingdom so that these products can be marketed again .
For that reason embryos are not covered by the decision that the Commission has taken today .
And so , Mr Fischler , these feeds keep turning up .
First of all , Commissioner , do some investigation and tell us the names of those British companies which manufactured these feeds in the 1980s .
I already know what you are going to say : you have not got this list .
Well then , get your staff to compile it .
That is not the case .
The substance of the British ban is that such meal and such feed must not be given to any farm animal , so pigs and other livestock must not be fed with it .
The point now is to ensure that factories manufacturing such products in the future will work safely .
Prion research was less advanced in those days .
I would like to thank Commissioner Fischler for coming here once again and giving us an up-to-date statement .
I also welcome the fact that he is going to present a financial package at a future meeting .
However , I was a little concerned to hear him say it was going to be confined to farmers .
As he rightly pointed out , the whole agricultural industry within the United Kingdom is affected financially by the crisis that has been brought on by the British Government 's inaction in this area .
First of all , Mr Thomas , I should like to point out that the main purpose of the short-term measures is to alleviate the losses suffered directly by producers .
In addition , the Commission certainly also wants to assist industry in effecting any essential changes to its production processes and will make use of the structural funds earmarked for that purpose .
Before doing anything else , we need to ensure that the necessary measures to restore consumer confidence can be set in motion now and that safe production processes can be guaranteed .
Thereafter , once the export ban is lifted , a programme can be submitted with the aim of intensifying and improving the marketing of meat .
I believe this would be a fairly logical approach .
At the moment , all of the information with which scientists are providing us seems to indicate that this vertical transmissibility , in other words infection of offspring by parents , does not take place .
This research programme is scheduled to last for a number of years .
No findings have emerged as yet .
Mr Colom i Naval , the measures we envisage are , in their financial dimension , mainly market measures .
You must bear in mind that intervention alone will use up a large percentage of the resources .
The cost of buying 100 000 tonnes of beef into intervention has to be estimated at around ECU 200 million .
In the month of April alone we have taken 50 000 tonnes of beef off the market .
Moreover , the fact is that we are not paying for the slaughter of older cattle ; that cost has to be borne entirely by the United Kingdom .
That is essentially the health measure .
What we in the Community are paying for , or paying a 70 % share of , is only the money for the cattle .
This means that we are paying the price received by the farmer for each head of cattle he hands over .
These are the two main elements to be taken into account when assessing the cost of BSE .
I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on his fine suntan , no doubt from the Italian sun .
I hope he will continue his valiant efforts to make sure that the sun can once again shine on the United Kingdom 's meat industry .
The World Health Organization says that gelatine and tallow are safe .
Your inspection teams have reached similar conclusions but we have a capacity problem in the United Kingdom .
Our renderers cannot process the animals for slaughter because a tallow lake has grown up as a result of the export ban .
In my constituency there is over 10 , 000 gallons of tallow waiting to be moved from renderers .
The slaughtering of animals which are at risk and the lifting of the ban on gelatine and tallow therefore go hand in hand .
Mr Watson , perhaps I can outline to you briefly the procedure involved here , because a separate procedure applies in this instance .
First of all , the Commission has to present a proposal to the Standing Veterinary Committee - and I ask you to distinguish carefully between the veterinary committees here , since there are several of them .
This proposal will be tabled at the next meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee , which we have scheduled for 15 May .
The next step will depend on the decision reached by the Standing Veterinary Committee .
If a qualified majority emerges there , the Commission will then have the opportunity to take a final decision .
If the Council does not reach a decision , jurisdiction will be transferred back to the Commission .
If a simple majority of the Council rejects the proposal , however , that decision is final .
That is the procedure , and we are bound by it .
Finally , can he say whether or not the Community is involved in , is sponsoring , or is aware of , any progress being made on the development of a live test for BSE ?
That would seem to me to be very important for the future .
There was only a telephone call half an hour before the announcement in the House of Commons , informing me that it would be made .
It is , I believe , rather obvious that such an announcement and the subsequent publicity will automatically result in a quite drastic loss of public confidence .
That is a far more fundamental aspect .
This additional slaughter programme is also about reducing the chances of future BSE outbreaks .
In addition , it must also be clearly understood that the disease cannot be diagnosed until it has virtually reached the terminal stage and that the incubation period , as we know , is extremely long .
Mr President , I usually find the Commissioner 's replies very satisfactory , as I do in this case too .
The members of our Group on the Committee on Agriculture say that he always keeps us on the right lines in the BSE question .
What I wonder as a simple representative of the public is why the people of Britain are still not satisfied with the efforts Europe is making financially .
I notice that all European countries are going to very great trouble to avoid spending in a number of areas because funds are needed for the BSE affair .
Can the Commissioner tell us , for the British public too , what exactly , more or less , the contributions for England are going to cost us all ?
But what we can say is that we are ready to assume what amounts to 70 % of the value of the 700 000 or so cattle over 30 months old that are slaughtered every year .
I welcome the Commissioner 's statement about the progressive lifting of the ban .
We were promised that in Luxembourg and now we are having this for tallow .
I should like to ask him about two things he mentioned .
One was about the inspection group : how long did it visit Scotland in particular , and also Northern Ireland and England .
Nobody seemed to know about it in Scotland .
Was it a secret visit ?
Secondly , concerning labelling in terms of origin . This seems to be quite an acceptable method of dealing with foodstuffs .
Has that been explored with the British Government in terms of certificates of origin / veterinary certificates ?
As I said in my introductory remarks , we are actually in agreement on a phased approach .
It is correct that the number of BSE cases that have occurred in Northern Ireland is distinctly below the UK average .
Secondly , it is also true that Northern Ireland has a more up-to-date identification system for cattle .
However , we have not yet received any concrete proposals to this effect .
My first question is : how soon can we expect a compensation package to be put in place ?
This also means that I shall be submitting proposals for that purpose to the Commission next Wednesday .
On the question of offal and its safe disposal , it is not really research that we need , because it is quite clear how offal can be safely disposed of .
What we need here is meticulous and comprehensive implementation of these measures .
Mr President , mad cow disease has provided a wonderful opportunity for several Member States to introduce , unilaterally , protectionist measures which are completely contrary to the Treaty and to the undertakings they have entered into .
What precisely has the Commission done to put a stop to this kind of measure ?
Mr Herman , one component of the decision that was taken is that the unilateral measures adopted at national level should be revoked without delay .
These measures have been taken by quite a number of Member States , including the United Kingdom , which enacted a unilateral order regarding the import of cattle to Britain .
But I note your failure to reply to the question put by my neighbour , Mr Collins .
Public health matters , too , and you have said that transmission does not take place .
There is no vertical transmission .
Let us view these certainties with suspicion .
I believe it is absolutely necessary that you should answer that question : what is the situation in terms of human health , as opposed to bovine health ?
Are there any possibilities of information exchange and joint research in the European Union ?
Most of the comment I have heard on this matter has come from the agriculture ministers , not the health ministers .
I agree with you when you advise great caution .
We have no proof of the existence of such transmission .
That in itself , however , does not automatically constitute proof that the disease was contracted in one of these ways .
We must keep that in mind .
That is also the reason why I have asked the leading researchers who are working on these questions in various parts of the world to assist us in dealing with these very complex issues .
Professor Weissmann , along with his colleagues who are working on this throughout the world , has expressed willingness to devise a strategy for defining the necessary research priorities .
Mr President , I have a question regarding the obligation to report outbreaks of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease .
I know that in a regional hospital in my home state ten people died of that disease last year .
The second thing I find rather unsatisfactory is your statement that it is uncertain whether transmission to embryos is not in fact possible .
As far as I know , London Zoo has even proved that it is possible , using another species of animal .
A dialysate made from calves ' blood is used throughout Europe .
It is reputedly very safe .
As far as the obligation to report outbreaks of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is concerned , I am afraid that this , being a health matter , is not part of my portfolio .
I cannot give you an answer to that question off the top of my head .
I only know that there is an obligation to report cases of BSE , which falls within my remit .
Every case of BSE must be reported to the national authorities as well as to the European authorities .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to ask two questions . The Commissioner is putting a lot of emphasis on slaughter .
Slaughtering is a kind of target-practice : nobody knows for sure whether the animals being slaughtered are suffering from the disease or not . But the main question has to do with what we are eating .
Beef has been banned in all countries . What effective controls are being carried out and what measures have been taken to control every farm , in that any farmer could use feed meal ?
The question of feeding animal , meat and bone meals is clearly regulated .
I have explained the system that already exists in Britain .
I do not need to repeat my explanation .
But there is a ban that applies throughout the EU on the feeding of meat and bone meals to ruminants .
That is regulated for the whole Union , which means that you actually have no cause for concern .
First of all , I note that the Commission is moving in the right direction .
That would have prevented a great deal of trouble for consumers and the farming community .
Commissioner , can you confirm that you have received assurances from all members of the Council that the Commission will be kept up to date in future on all interim findings and final results of research experiments ?
I ask this in view of the successive cover-ups we have experienced in the past .
What conclusions do you draw from such reports with regard to the way in which the campaign against BSE is being handled in the United Kingdom ?
Can you ensure that the export ban will only be relaxed when all animals everywhere can be definitively and reliably identified ?
Let me begin with the cover-up attempts .
I can assure you of one thing , namely that I shall do everything in my power to forestall any such moves .
What conclusion should we draw ?
The only possible logical conclusion , in fact , is that this feed ban , sad to say , has not been universally observed .
I also asked the British Agriculture Minister for the date from which he could guarantee total compliance with the feed ban .
His answer was that he could guarantee it from 1 April 1996 .
I wish to thank the Commissioner and put two brief questions .
This proposal will be presented to the Standing Veterinary Committee on 15 May for discussion and approval .
The committee needs to approve the proposal by a qualified majority so that the Commission can then take its final decision .
Your second question concerns cattle that can be guaranteed never to have been fed with such dubious products .
I warmly welcome your statement today , Mr Fischler , and the progress which has been made in moving towards a gradual lifting of the ban .
I have three questions .
Firstly , exactly what is wrong with the identification system in Britain ?
You mentioned ensuring that the measures are effectively implemented .
Is this any worse in Britain than in any other Member State ?
Are European rules not being adequately implemented ?
Some clarification would be welcome .
Secondly rumours abound in my country that there is BSE on the continent but not necessarily from the export of British animals .
Can you categorically confirm there is no BSE in other Member States , other than from the export of British animals ?
That makes it quite expensive and time-consuming to investigate these things .
We cannot always do that here because we cannot obtain the requisite data .
Hence the importance of better identification and marking of cattle .
That does not mean , however , that this is a specifically British problem ; there are also defects in the way rules are implemented in other Member States .
Let there be no doubt about that either .
Our aim is to improve the situation throughout Europe , in other words throughout the Union .
On the other hand there are the so-called ' native cases ' , i.e. cases in which no such connection can be proved .
These cases therefore need to be examined with particular care .
Your third question concerns the live tests .
I think these facts demonstrate the impossibility of guaranteeing free movement of goods in Europe .
Otherwise the unity of the market and the free movement of goods in the European Union would be threatened .
Mr Vallvé , you are well aware of the rules governing question time .
Your question was not relevant to the present subject .
I shall leave it to the Commissioner whether he wishes to answer it , but he need not answer it .
The rule is that we keep to the agreed topic !
Mr President , with your agreement I shall give a brief answer .
We know of the case , and we have asked the French Government to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to prevent any future recurrence .
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that while we discuss BSE here consumers are reacting by turning away from beef in increasing numbers .
You have referred to the identification of meat , in other words to the label of origin .
I am still not quite clear why there should be any great difference between that and the labelling of fruit and vegetables .
The nutritional consultant for top German athletes always says that it is far more difficult to achieve a balanced diet without meat than with meat .
I am a bit concerned that this issue is now becoming seriously divisive .
What is being done to establish firmly the principle of indicating the origin of meat throughout the EU ?
Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert , why is labelling considerably more difficult for meat than it is for fruit and vegetables ?
There are two aspects , which I believe are important , to be considered .
First of all , you must not forget that , when an apple has grown somewhere or other , the origin of that apple is fairly clear .
But what about the origin of a bull that is born in one country , sold as a calf to another country , raised there and then sent to a third country for slaughter ?
And it may also have been fed with cattle feed from overseas .
What is the origin of that bull ?
This question is more complex than is generally believed .
The second aspect that has to be considered is the fact that there are two separate issues here that are repeatedly confused .
Do we want a simple indication of origin , or a genuine labelling system , with a special stamp denoting the origin of the meat ?
I would also thank the Commissioner for coming to discuss the issue with us again today .
I am concerned with the matter of food labelling .
Why is it that we can have rules for labelling food for human consumption but not for animal feed ?
Is the Commissioner proposing to look into this in the future and to come up with some ideas ?
From now on , it must be stated on every sack of feed whether or not the feed may be given to ruminants , and that applies throughout the Union .
That is why we must monitor very carefully those cases of BSE that are identified in countries other than the United Kingdom .
Can you tell us whether , on those farms where BSE has been confirmed , the disease has been caused by imports of live cattle from the United Kingdom or by imports of meat-containing feed ?
Mr Goerens , I have already pointed out that in these cases which have occurred outside the United Kingdom we are confronted with different types of case .
There are animals that have been imported from Britain and have subsequently contracted BSE as well as cases in which the feed given to animals originated in Britain .
There are cases in which this connection cannot be proved .
From a medical point of view , as well as from the perspective of farmers outside the United Kingdom , I consider it important to clarify one point again here .
Let me come back first of all to the question of safety with regard to gelatine .
The safety of gelatine depends on two factors .
The first is the question of the tissues selected for the manufacture of gelatine at the outset .
The second factor is the way in which gelatine is manufactured , the process .
This process , of course , comprises several stages - heat treatment , simultaneous pressurizing and also acid curing .
So if a certain standard is maintained at each of these stages of the manufacturing process , there can be no doubt that the gelatine is safe .
That reflects the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the more detailed interpretation of the recommendations by the Standing Veterinary Committee .
On the second question , which you asked in connection with Mr Böge 's earlier question , I understood Mr Böge to be referring to the 1990 proposal .
You spoke about a decision taken in 1993 .
I am not quite clear about that .
I also wish to thank the Commissioner for the fullness and openness of his reporting to Parliament .
Secondly , in the measures to assist beef producers who have lost money , will he be proposing that all beef producers who have suffered serious loss will be compensated .
In particular I refer to the tradition in the common agricultural policy of applying premiums to male animals only .
Are people who specialize in producing female animals rather than male animals going to be left out once again ?
Mr McCartin , let us look first of all at these additional promotion measures .
As I have said , we shall be tabling proposals and ideas here .
It is too soon to deliver a definitive opinion on the matter today .
But our proposals will be submitted within this framework , and at that point it will surely be necessary to talk about this year 's price package in connection with the present discussion .
That is another question that will have to be discussed in this context .
We all recognize that BSE had its roots in the feeding of ruminants with high protein meal and also bonemeal .
I do not want to add to the scare but bonemeal is extensively used in the horticultural industry .
Therefore I would ask what action has been taken or might be taken to advise the horticultural industry ?
Can we now set a date for that inquiry ?
Ladies and gentlemen , that brings us to the end of Question Time .
Our thanks go to Commissioner Fischler for making himself available for almost one and a half hours to answer our questions here .
Situation in Burundi
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions :
Mr President , the news from Burundi in the last few days is simply bewildering .
There is talk of an average of 1000 deaths a month .
Masses of refugees are leaving the country and choosing the road to Zaire where there are already 1 million Rwandan refugees .
The position there is explosive .
Today or tomorrow it may come to genocide .
A coup is almost certain .
What is happening in Burundi is terrible , all the more so as democratic elections have been held there .
Unfortunately the first democratic president was murdered on 21 October 1993 .
Nevertheless he had put together a government whose composition was not ethnically one-sided .
Since then the tension between the army and the civil authority has escalated to an intolerable level .
Attacks here , refugees there , fear everywhere .
It is also clear that the events in Rwanda are having considerable repercussions on development in Burundi .
The Burundian army is finding support in Rwanda and in Uganda .
The international community has brought Burundi to independence .
Why does this international community do nothing to bring such countries to democratic adulthood ?
We think it is very urgent to draw attention to the climate of civil war which may lead to genocide .
We know that the Member States of the European Union are far from unanimous , and are sometimes even antagonistic to a European policy with regard to countries such as Burundi .
One American newspaper wrote that proposals from the United States , obviously more interested in peace in Africa than Europe , and other countries in the United Nations , are blocked by European countries .
What attempt is being made to silence the radio stations which are preaching hate and murder ?
Or are we merely distributing humanitarian aid without going further into the problem ?
What are we doing in the way of preventive diplomacy ?
Or are we letting that degenerate into a ridiculous slogan ?
What are we doing about it ?
This Parliament has approved a joint programme for Burundi .
What does that mean ?
May I remind you that ex-President Carter tried twice to bring about a great peace conference ?
Now ex-President Nyerere has accepted an assignment and the European Council has entrusted Ambassador Ajello with the task of mediating .
He came to the Committee on Foreign Affairs here this week and complained about the financing of his mission .
Is anything being done about that ?
Who gives him his brief and to whom will he deliver his report ?
Our representative also said that he had made an appeal for cooperation to the Organization for African Unity .
With all due respect for this institution , it ought to be possible to report a difficult operation which has been brought to a happy conclusion by the Organization for African Unity with all its good intentions .
Now talks are going to be held , whilst people are being murdered in Burundi .
Negotiations yes , but with whom and how ? We must see that they include democracy .
Why are Boutros Ghali 's proposals not being followed up ?
The last of them was on 15 February this year .
Why not announce an arms embargo ?
In that connection I have one reservation with regard to paragraph 10 of the joint compromise text which we are considering to reach a joint motion for a resolution .
I accept that it might be said that Burundi 's neighbouring States sometimes give help to the warring factions in that country .
What does the Council intend to do ?
Is there no-one left today to convert a historic moral link into equivalent modern political terms , which means that all Member States assume joint responsibility , or do we prefer a new post-colonial war through African go-betweens ?
Mr President , the serious situation of political and military instability still prevailing in Burundi is raising serious concern in my Group , the Group of the United European Left .
Finally Burundi 's neighbouring countries , such as Zaire , which is fanning the flames of conflict need to take up their responsibilities .
In short , the enormous financial commitments undertaken since 1993 by the European Union in favour of Burundi cannot fail to imply also the Union 's strong and decisive political presence .
It is however necessary now to reflect upon what role the international community might develop to stop this tragedy , which in 1995 caused roughly 15 000 deaths and a worryingly small number of wounded and prisoners .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , fear rules in Burundi .
Fear on both sides .
Fear of being massacred on the Tutsi side , and they have seen an example .
Fear and also rage and disenchantment on the side of the Hutus , who are excluded from power despite the fact that they have won elections democratically .
In that respect many chances have been gambled away in Burundi .
In that connection I should like to say that France is backing completely the wrong horse by putting Mobutu forward at this time to solve problems .
Mobutu is interested in disorder and can play a part again on the international scene only by not solving the conflict .
He cannot make any positive contribution to solving it .
It is therefore a thousand pities that France of all countries should breach solidarity in the framework of the European Union and should also break the agreements made in the troika at the time .
On that last point , I think the European Union has only one possibility at the moment after all that has gone wrong .
That is , first , to support the initiatives of Nyerere who is the only one at the moment who may still possibly achieve something - I say possibly - at the negotiating level .
What Nyerere says is , in contrast to the solution of the conflict in former Yugoslavia , have I got another stick to wield , or another carrot to get people over the bridge .
As far as that is concerned I think there is a real duty to support Nyerere at both levels .
Where on earth is political awareness in the Committee on Budgets ?
That , ladies and gentlemen , is what I call a real scandal !
To that end it adopted on 24 March 1995 a common position on Burundi and between February 1995 and February 1996 four missions have gone there .
The European Union has repeatedly condemned the violence and has urged moderation .
The troika urged the Burundi authorities to seek a timely solution to the refugee problem , bringing into force the measures aimed at removing fear and restoring confidence .
The troika has requested the Government of Burundi to do its utmost to that end .
He will support the efforts of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity and those of the well-known African figures assisting both organizations .
He will establish and maintain close contact with the governments of the region and other governments and organizations concerned in order to see what measures are to be adopted to solve the problems of the region .
The technical details relating to the appointment of Mr Ajello are defined in the common programme adopted by the Council on 25 March 1996 .
Mr Nyerere is proposing to organize further talks between the political parties in Burundi on 22 May next at Mwanza in Tanzania .
As confirmed in the declaration of 16 January 1996 , the European Union is ready to help the recovery of Burundi .
It is ready to help it in particular by supporting measures in favour of peace and reconciliation between the various groups , measures which ought to be adopted by the Burundi authorities .
It has issued a reminder that only political solutions will make it possible to bring a permanent end to the conflict .
However , this promising situation , which showed signs of encouragement has since 15 March of this year begun to deteriorate significantly .
It is against this background that we must decide what political action to take in the future .
From my point of view , we must be very clear : there must be a division of tasks between the various people and bodies taking part .
Finally , in respect of economic aid given by the European Union , this is continuing and will continue and can be substantially reinforced once the conditions are in place for it to be executed .
From this point of view I think that support given to President Nyerere , which has already been expressed by the Council , the Commission and so vehemently by the European Parliament , is a prerequisite for success .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there were more of you here just now when we were talking about cows , but of course I do realize that we were dealing with very important economic issues .
Now we are talking about people and , it seems , the subject is arousing less and less interest !
It 's always the same , you know .
People accuse us of meddling in things that are none of our business , but we can also sit back and do nothing .
After all , we are talking about Africans .
They are all black , and they are a long way away .
And we do not know what to do .
If we do nothing at all then perhaps , after all , things will not get any worse .
There is the Carter mission , which has not produced any results so far . There is , of course , the very , very important intervention of President Julius Nyerere .
Will all this be enough ? What are we being asked to do apart from these resolutions ?
America is , indeed , beginning to move . Cannot we , for our part , send more than five observers ?
Five - not much of an effort , is it ? We asked for it and resolutions will be adopted , but what are we going to do ?
Provide extra money ? Is that what we are going to do ?
So here again we need effective action . We cannot entrust all our refugees , the police and the army to Zaire , and wait for it to happen .
Finally , there is a need for UN monitors , political decisions , a political will .
We must support Mr Boutros Ghali 's efforts to set up that force and provide it with a leader .
It will be the Africans who have to bring it into being , but we must help them to do so .
We have listened to pleas , we have formulated resolutions , and we wonder what purpose they have ever served .
I naturally wish the observer every success , but I have my doubts as to whether we can achieve anything significant here .
I do not fully understand Mr Pettinari when he says that we should exercise such restraint towards Zaire .
But if it bears responsibility , it should also be included in the contacts and talks that are needed in the region .
We must not forget , of course , that other countries besides Zaire have a part to play .
So if we are to support a negotiator - and I agree here with the Commissioner - the President of Tanzania really ought to receive our backing .
It will also help to instil a greater degree of self-assurance among the African peoples if we put our faith in their ability to contribute to the resolution of this conflict and therefore involve them from the outset .
Lastly , we must have all parties round the negotiating table .
Mr President , we are helpless spectators of the hellish spiral of violence in Burundi .
Everyone has said so .
The word ' genocide ' is not one to be used lightly , yet what other term can we use to describe the thousands of deaths that have occurred since the crisis began ?
Not a day goes by without violence , torture and crime , inflicted on women and children as well as men .
The Member States represented on the Security Council must talk the same language , in New York and in Brussels .
Yet it has to be said that their lines of action are totally divergent .
Contradictions like this are calculated to undermine completely the process of normalization in Burundi .
A joint policy has to be consistent if it is to be credible , and therefore effective .
Dispatching a special envoy to Burundi is an excellent step in itself , and we can only congratulate Mr Ajello on his determination .
But it is incumbent upon the Council to arrive at a clearer definition of what its mission is .
Mr Boutros Ghali 's proposal that an armed preventive force should be deployed on the frontiers of Burundi , on permanent standby , was an excellent one .
Indeed , the very threat that that force might be established helped to calm things down last February .
The Security Council rejected that request , and I genuinely believe that the European Union should exert pressure to ensure that the right steps are taken to follow it up .
I must emphasize the humanitarian aid provided by the European Commission .
But our financial intervention , highly important though it is , sadly demonstrates our political impotence and calls upon us to adopt a different course of action .
What is the Commission 's role in the Ajello mission , and in the coordination of the Nyerere mission ?
We must bring pressure to bear on Zaire to stop it being the turntable for the arms traffic in that region .
The European Union must bring all its strength to bear to force Zaire to shut down those radio stations that incite people to hatred .
In this context , incidentally , the Commission 's move to set up a conciliatory radio station is a good idea .
The need now is to ensure that it can transmit twenty-four hours a day .
Why has the Council still not operationally implemented the measures outlined in the Carcassonne plan for finding a solution to the Burundi crisis ?
Along the same lines , Mr Nyerere 's initiative to bring both the controlling forces and the extremist groups to the same negotiating table deserves our full support .
This is the only way to move forward through dialogue to national reconciliation .
It really is a disgrace !
It is time we stopped pretending to be anxious to help Burundi with all our fine words while at the same time cutting off the financial aid that could enable this mission to achieve the success we hope for .
Mr President , for several months we believed that things were calming down .
In November , December and January there were actually grounds for hoping that a degree of internal peace might return to Burundi .
The resumption of violence came as all the more unpleasant a surprise as a result .
At all events , it is clear today that things are deteriorating , accompanied , sadly , by a drastic political breakdown within the country .
First , there is internal breakdown within the Government , where we see a President of the Republic and a Prime Minister unable to speak the same language .
There is a political breakdown , too , among the political parties and leading political figures who , themselves , are at present almost universally discredited .
So what we have at this moment is a country on the brink of chaos .
Fortunately , there are countries in that region that can offer some help .
It is true that Tanzania and its former President , Julius Nyerere , are offering a pale glimmer of hope .
It should be added that Mr Nyerere himself is particularly pessimistic , according to such information as can be obtained .
Then there is Uganda , which goes to the polls tomorrow , and it is also true that the presence of President Museveni is probably a relatively stabilizing factor .
But there is also Zaire .
Even so , I should like to sound two cautionary notes .
First , following the appointment of Aldo Ajello , who should receive our unconditional support in what he is doing , this House should be alerted to the fact that the budget has still not been released .
Secondly , it is indeed necessary that , on this occasion , Europe should speak with a single voice .
Those States who want to go it alone or advance the pawn of their supposed national interests in Africa should be warned .
Mr President , at this stage of the debate virtually everything has already been said .
But I should like to add some information which has come to me directly from Burundi , provided by nongovernment organizations which are maintaining their presence in that country in spite of the difficulties .
It has already been said that the situation has gradually deteriorated over the past two months .
The provinces most affected are Gitega - the most important province in the country - Rutana , Civitoque and Macamba .
In the capital , Bujumbura , ethnic cleansing is under way and leading members of the Hutu population are being wiped out by attacks for which both armed bands and the army are responsible .
Frodebu accepts the reform of the army , but Uprona does not agree and he , Uprona , refuses to negotiate with the armed bands suspected of having participated in the genocide in Rwanda .
In view of all that , what can we do ? I think we must support Mr Nyerere in spite of the internal difficulties he is having .
Corruption , chaos and humanitarian disaster are advancing with giant strides , and in this respect I think it is important for us to make certain proposals such as :
Such pressure should also include consideration of measures against the neighbouring States . I agree that all those neighbouring States which are supporting the armed groups with weapons and protection should be named .
Fourthly , decisive support for a regional solution which was raised during the meeting in Tunis from 16 to 19 March this year .
I think the number of international observers is insufficient and will have to be increased .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Burundi , sadly , is on the agenda again - and how many times does that make now ?
It is a sad state of affairs , because the situation is still very difficult , still desperate .
Reports come in unabated of the Burundi army killing unarmed civilians .
We find it deeply disturbing that appeals addressed to the Burundi authorities to prevent further atrocities are completely ignored .
Nevertheless , the armed forces are still engaged in the same activities as they were pursuing last autumn .
They , the armed forces , are ultimately ensuring that there will be no independent witnesses to report offences that have been committed .
Pressure must be applied from our side on the Burundi Government , pressure which is perfectly legitimate , since its purpose is to induce the Government to try and make the Burundi legal system work better .
If the situation is not to be further destabilized , those responsible for acts of terrorism must be brought to justice without delay .
To this end , the European Union must not oppose the granting of aid targeted specifically at the establishment of an effective legal system .
Mr President , in 1994 / 1995 the international community was paralysed by the events in Rwanda and in Bosnia .
Over one million people died as a result of that inaction .
Now we continue to pick up the pieces and we measure the cost of that inaction in lives lost and in humanitarian aid .
In Burundi , ethnic polarization is increasingly taking place and the Tutsi minority are clearly taking power and influence in the judiciary , in the police and in the government .
As always , it is the innocent civilians who are the victims of these actions and of the increasing tension in Burundi : mostly women , elderly people and children .
The estimate now is that up to a thousand people die every month in Burundi .
This clearly calls for very strong measures to be taken .
First , increased financial support for human rights observers and longer term measures to establish the rule of law and respect for human rights .
Thirdly , we need more resources and support for the process of national dialogue .
African leaders and OAU members should be central to this .
All donors , including the European Union , must now make bilateral and multilateral support dependent upon the implementation of these measures .
Mr President , I thank all those who have spoken for the very interesting information they have given the presidency .
I shall reply in detail to a number of points which have emerged in the debate .
I agree with Mr Tindemans about the deterioration of the situation and the risks which it may involve throughout the area .
We may remember that there are more than 1 million refugees in that country , with obvious negative repercussions of an economic , political and environmental nature .
My answer to Mr Baldi is that the European Union is giving financial support to the observer mission of the Organization of African Unity amounting to ECU 1.5 million .
In addition many Member States of the European Union are making financial contributions towards the initiative .
My reply to Mrs Aelvoet is that we share her confidence in Nyerere and I should like to say also that Mr Ajello 's mandate expressly envisages support for the efforts being made to solve the crisis .
I much appreciated Mr Kouchner 's speech .
We understand moreover his rightful impatience but , precisely because the solution must be above all an African solution , what Europe must do is to encourage that type of solution by every means .
I should like to tell Mr Günther that for myself I agree that it is necessary to involve the Africans because it they hold the basic solution to the crisis .
My reply to Mrs André-Léonard is that Mr Ajello 's mandate may be reviewed every three months .
That means that the Council will consider whether it will be appropriate to confirm his assignment or change it .
I would inform Mr Pradier that for myself I agree that the future political order in Uganda may undoubtedly have consequences for the future of the region .
I must emphasize to Mr Berend that the troika 's missions and the bilateral contacts have always laid particular stress on the problem of the judicial system .
I would say to Mrs Kinnock that the arms embargo and the restriction of arms have already been examined in United Nations Resolution No 1040 .
However , the Council will be taking that measure into consideration .
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
Annual economic report for 1995
Mr President , I should first like to pay tribute to the Commissioner and his staff for the great cooperation we have had from them .
Also , I should like to pay tribute across the floor to the cooperation I have received from Mr Wolf who was the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment .
However , we managed to reach an acceptable compromise in the end and on the whole that is the adjective I would apply to this report . It is acceptable .
Indeed , I would go so far as to say that there is something in it to please everyone , including members of your group , Mr President .
I should like to concentrate on one or two items which are in the resolution . I will pick out the things in the resolution which I personally consider are most important .
I am quite certain that the speakers who will follow me in this debate will pick up other things as well .
But we warn the Commission and the Council that the factors for that are not yet in place . There are some items of regret .
It would have been interesting to know why the Commission believes that unemployment is so much lower in those places .
We regret that the report has not addressed the underlying causes of depressed business and consumer confidence .
There are some - perhaps surprising - acknowledgments of the need for flexibility .
I should like to end with one question to the Commission .
This Annual Economic Report is part of a two-stage process ; the next stage is the Commission 's broad economic guidelines .
The question I should like to put to the Commissioner is when does he expect to be able to present to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy the Commission 's broad economic guidelines ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the comments about the good general understanding between Mr Cassidy and myself were certainly not unfounded .
That also played a fair part in the process .
I believe there is a point here that we really must take very seriously .
I do not mean that we are about to make history , but I do think that history is about to catch up with us .
These issues certainly merit closer examination .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as long ago as 28 February this year you were kind enough to invite me to attend the debate on the economic situation .
The opinion that you adopt at the end of this debate will , of course , be taken into consideration for the purposes of defining the broad guidelines of economic policy .
Incidentally , I shall be presenting those guidelines before the competent authorities of this House on 21 May this year .
First , the analysis .
Admittedly , the present rate of economic growth is disappointing .
However , the underlying trend is still upward , and the indications of recovery in the second half-year are real enough .
According to the data presently available , the increase in GDP in 1995 is unlikely to exceed 2.5 % , whereas we initially hoped for 3 % .
In 1996 , too , activity seems lower than expected .
The first two quarters of 1996 have fallen short of the forecasts we made last autumn .
Annual growth over 1996 will , of course , reflect this .
On 28 February I suggested to you that growth would probably be below 2 % in 1996 .
In the light of our current forecast , it will be well below that figure .
You know the reasons for this decline in 1995 and early 1996 .
Indeed , you yourselves have endorsed the main factors cited in the Annual Economic Report .
The fourth reason was monetary fluctuations : the European currencies strengthened against the dollar , but they also varied sharply among themselves in 1994 and 1995 .
Those fluctuations accounted for about 20 % of the job losses incurred in the Union between 1993 and 1995 .
Yet this diagnosis does suggest grounds for optimism .
Several of the factors I have just mentioned are undergoing a process of change .
There are two major types of factor that seem to me to be important .
First , the improvement in the basic economic data .
Several positive trends are likely to have a beneficial effect on recovery .
Exports , for example , should increase thanks to the strengthening of the dollar and brisk international demand .
The rate of inflation is also exceptionally low : 3.1 % in 1995 .
Finally , we should also note the stability of European exchange rates within the European Monetary System .
All these are essential factors , but they will not be sufficient unless the economic actors regain confidence .
That is the main challenge of 1996 .
Without confidence in itself , Europe has no future .
To answer your rapporteur , let me quote the words of Goethe : ' Pessimists are doomed to be no more than observers . '
If Europe is not to lose its way , it can and must fight , and be determined to win .
It has the resources .
Indeed , the confidence indicators have stopped deteriorating in most Member States over the past few months .
That in itself gives us reason to be optimistic .
Furthermore , this return of confidence is based on very firm political commitments .
First , 1996 is notable for the determination of several Member States , including France and Germany , to reduce their public deficits .
From this situation , with its weaknesses and its encouraging signs , I would draw various conclusions which must guide us in determining the guidelines of European Economic Policy .
Before it can once again be clearly oriented towards growth , Europe must set its sights on three objectives .
The first is to continue the process of putting the public accounts in order .
It is essential that not only budget deficits but social spending deficits , too , should be reduced .
Your rapporteur welcomed the reduction in public deficits since 1993 , but he also noted , quite rightly , that the debt-to-GDP ratio now amounts to 71 % of GDP .
That is a lot , in fact it is too much .
So we must continue the efforts that have been made to reduce deficits , not change horses in midstream .
No reduction would be either sufficient or sustainable unless the States tackle the problem of social spending .
The countries of Europe cannot avoid the need to reform their social systems .
That is the only way in which we can preserve the European social model and European living standards in the future .
Clearly , this reform cannot and must not be imposed upon our fellow citizens - it must be achieved through and by social dialogue .
In this context , the social partners , and not governments alone , must face up to their responsibilities , which are substantial .
In addition , the continuing and convergent rectification of public accounts is a precondition for achieving the second objective : economic and monetary union .
Only a single currency can bring Europe 's citizens the full advantages of the single market in terms of growth and employment .
Having a single market without economic and monetary union is much the same as issuing a credit card without providing any way of using it .
The recent slowing of growth must not induce us to question this objective .
I know , in any case , that the European Parliament agrees with this analysis .
Your rapporteur quite rightly recalled that it is ' extremely important to introduce the single currency ' , and I welcome that .
In order to achieve this objective , we must adhere to the timetable laid down by the European Council in Madrid and keep the preparatory work moving at a steady rhythm .
These matters will , of course , be referred to you .
The decisions will have to be taken at the European Council in Dublin in December .
All the technical groundwork for the introduction of EMU will thus have been completed , in line with the timetable laid down in the Treaty and in the Green Paper .
In the short term , though , Europe also desperately needs an active policy to promote employment .
This is our third objective .
The Union 's initiatives have been launched .
The first steps have already been taken .
Let me quickly mention three of them .
The initiative by the President of the Commission for the signature of a European pact of confidence for employment is essential .
It represents the concrete embodiment of the lever effect exercised by the Union .
An important step was the round table of 28 and 29 April , where a dialogue took place between the social partners .
The next step will be the Joint Council of the Ministers of Finance and Social Affairs , then the tripartite conference , then the European Council in Florence .
At that Council , the Commission will be presenting a communication on the state of progress of the pact for employment .
Swift action is needed in this area .
That is what Europe 's citizens expect .
Furthermore , your committee , in its report , asks that the Council and Commission ' consider urgently investment-stimulating measures and the provision of financial aid to SMEs ' .
The Commission fully supports these two ideas .
Second initiative : the transEuropean networks .
The Commission wants , as you do , to see the first transeuropean network programmes launched as soon as possible .
It is unacceptable that no start has yet been made on implementing a decision taken , in principle , at the European Council in Edinburgh more than four years ago .
But it is unreasonable to defend this idea while at the same time refusing the necessary funds for its implementation .
Third initiative : the SMEs .
Every study carried out to date stresses that the SMEs are the biggest creators of jobs .
As such , they must be supported .
In this connection I would recall that the Commission adopted , late in March , the third multiannual plan in favour of the SMEs , with a budget of ECU 180 million .
This relates to a European apparatus for guaranteeing loans for employment , which will also make it easier for SMEs to obtain access to bank financing .
In conclusion , let me say that I can see no objective reason liable to prevent a rapid improvement in the economic situation in Europe .
But , in order to support the recovery , we must have the courage to take various difficult decisions regarding a return to balanced public financing .
We also need the will to pursue specific policies aimed at supporting the activities and structural policies for combating unemployment .
Both of these are necessary if confidence is to be restored .
The presentation of the broad guidelines of economic policy will be an opportunity to specify even more clearly the means recommended by the Commission for continuing to put the European economy in order and force down unemployment .
As I said earlier , we shall have the opportunity to discuss this again in your committee on 21 May this year .
Mr President , this European Parliament has given proof of its maturity in today 's Cassidy report , which my group is happy to support , by tabling a proposal that looks to the future .
The dramatic development of unemployment is rightly at the heart of the annual economic report as well as of the motion for a resolution .
It is worrying that economic performance forecasts are repeatedly hyped up , only to be adjusted downwards without a single unemployed person having found a job .
The negative trends of past decades have taught us how important it is not to stifle and neglect domestic demand .
We share the concern expressed in the annual economic report about the lack of confidence among the economic players .
Here we need something more than a selffulfilling prophecy .
For that reason we must try to reverse the trend , and we can only reverse the trend by actually strengthening domestic demand , not by reducing the purchasing power of wage-earners .
We must not succumb to the illusion that we can reinvigorate the economy by dismantling the welfare state .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission 's annual economic report for 1996 clearly shows that the European Union is in a difficult economic situation .
Special efforts are therefore required .
I am convinced that a credible and consistent policy of stability has a preeminent role to play here .
It is a vital prerequisite of economic growth .
Its main function is to reduce the tax burden on businesses , which is a serious handicap to European industry in global competition .
I am aware that in the present situation there is a particularly great temptation to turn away from a policy of thrift and stability .
But we must not yield to that temptation .
High public deficits , and the higher interest rates needed to sustain them , prejudice economic and monetary union and thereby endanger jobs .
I believe that is something Mr Wolf should include in his reflections .
He basically said that we should start amassing higher debts again .
The specific measures that have to be taken will be presented by the Commission during the course of this coming week along with its report on the broad economic policy guidelines .
That report is likely to be adopted during the month of June .
Further improvements must be made in the participatory rights of the European Parliament , perhaps by means of interinstitutional agreements .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Brian Cassidy 's excellent report prompts me to make a few brief comments .
This analysis is sound in principle , and naturally receives our support .
Secondly , the report 's evaluation of the economic policies reflects a broad convergence of views with the Commission and the Council .
I would like Commissioner de Silguy , who is with us today , to know that in economic and budgetary matters the Commission has the keen support of our group .
In conclusion , I would like to address our two rapporteurs more directly .
Brian Cassidy would like a new deal , as he puts it , of a non-Keynesian type , based - he adds - on ecosolidarity .
I do not know what historians will make of this idea when they pore over it in 50 years ' time .
I hope to assist them by telling them that , today , I as a liberal am disconcerted , not to say dismayed .
The European economy seems paralysed , uncertain , and business people are not taking the decisions which would ensure , with more investment or a greater presence in foreign markets , that such growth took place .
Mr President , the Commission 's economic report coincides with the beginning of the process of reviewing the Maastricht Treaty .
It seems that it is a faithful , a most faithful child of that parent .
The proof is , first , that it confirms adherence to the convergence criteria every Member State must satisfy .
All this , on the pretext of competition between the major monopolistic enterprises so that by cutting labour costs they can increase their already excessive profits .
The report also confirms that Economic and Monetary Union will create multiple speeds among the countries that form the hard core .
Similar things are happening in other countries too with the philosophy of this economic report , the reforms about to take place .
Mr President , it is an excellent thing that this year 's report contains less wishful thinking than last year ' s .
I should like to congratulate Mr Cassidy and Mr Wolf on their good cooperation and on advocating a new development model .
Clearly it will not be possible to carry on in the same way as hitherto if difficult structural problems are to be tackled .
The question is how productivity growth can be distributed fairly , so that the welfare state can be saved and the tax base secured for the future .
I should like to draw attention to the ideas which the Commission has recently put forward concerning taxation .
I believe they are very promising .
The Commission has now suggested that taxation should be considered as a whole .
It has also said that the Member States have already lost much of their fiscal independence to the markets .
In the past 15 years , taxation of labour has grown very substantially , while taxation of many other factors of production has been reduced .
It is no wonder that it has proved impossible to do anything about unemployment .
But the Commission draws few conclusions from this as regards the possible realignment of its policies and recommendations .
Yet , if its policies are sound , and even if they have not yet been pursued completely to the end , they should at least be beginning to produce a few beneficial effects on employment .
Well , they are not doing so .
Indeed , rather the contrary seems to be happening .
One of these days , the Commission should ask itself why .
This presentation might give the impression that there are no problems .
The reality is very different .
In any case , the Commission itself fuels our misgivings when it notes , over the page , that ' the overall trend of investment is down ' .
This statement shows the previous one in a very different light .
Investment problems , as a whole , then , were worthy of a less soothing , more consistent and deeper analysis .
Clearly , this poor state of health of European investment would not be improved by taxation on capital , especially through the device of possible harmonization .
Yet this is a proposal which is popular in certain circles , on the pretext that spontaneous development has now brought about a situation in which labour is excessively taxed .
To the contrary , what is needed now - absolutely needed - is a reduction in the taxation of labour .
Nor will the ill health of European investment be improved , whatever people may say , by major projects partially financed by Community loans .
The fact is that these loans , which will have to be repaid tomorrow by levies on the Member States , will have to be added to the indebtedness of the States receiving them .
And we find that the central problem is unemployment , which is a major breakthrough . All this , of course , is clearly perceived by our rapporteurs .
They told us that the single market would mean the creation of five million jobs . Now the single market exists , and there are 18 million unemployed .
In the absence of stupidity , a causal relationship might have been established . Well , no , there is no causal relationship .
Stupidity ! They tell us that privatization is a way of filling in the hole in public financing , yet it is privatization that is digging the hole : 6 , 800 privatizations worldwide since 1980 .
Mr Cassidy , British Steel was privatized and three-quarters of the jobs were lost ; British Airways , on privatization , saw its workforce cut from 56 , 000 to 19 , 000 . And who compensates the unemployed ?
The stupidity , the idiocy of the convergence criteria , Mr de Silguy !
The French Government , trying to comply with Article 104c and the 3 % public deficit , increases taxes .
Stupidity - and here perhaps Mr de Silguy may agree with me on the part of Mr Juppé 's Government and the other European governments .
So what is the answer ? Is it all really evidence of stupidity ?
To those who know Mr Cassidy and Mr de Silguy , obviously not . They are dazzling intellects .
So there must be something else , and to find the answer we need to take a look at the beneficiaries of these policies . Who will benefit from the privatization of French Telecom , of Belgacom ?
Mr Cassidy , in paragraph 33 you tell us that we need to reduce the fiscal burden on labour .
That 's all very well , but how is it to be done ?
It could be paid for , for example , by a tax on CO2 , which will increase the costs of energy , something that is paid for by private individuals .
Naturally , the companies will find that their social charges fall in the meantime .
Clearly , this is not all a matter of chance .
In any case , Mr Cassidy , without making the point explicitly , you say on page 12 , and I quote , ' unemployment : the European Union 's priority ' .
You did not say ' the fight against unemployment ' , you said ' unemployment : the European Union 's priority ' .
Mr Cassidy , Commissioner , you have taken us back to the nineteenth century .
You have taken us back to the days before the Welfare State . It 's a fantastic trick .
From that standpoint , you have all my admiration .
Mr President , I was interested to hear the point Commissioner De Silguy made about the similarities between Mr Cassidy 's report and the Commission 's annual report .
If that is the case then Commissioner De Silguy has been looking at rather different documents to those that this House has looked at .
The one significant thing about the Commission 's annual economic report is its breathtaking complacency .
The Commissioner comes before us today and says that we can expect a growth rate of markedly less than 2 % within the European Union this year .
He then talks about the need to consolidate confidence in the European economy .
When President Santer took over the Commission he said the key feature of this Commission would be that it would do less better .
The only thing this Commission has done so far on economic policy is less .
We are still waiting for the better to be delivered .
The Commission document talks about a paradox in the European economy .
It says that we have strong economic fundamentals and yet we have depressed growth .
There is no paradox here and the Commissioner knows this .
Many economic experts are telling the Commissioner that there is no paradox in Europe 's economy .
In the next few weeks the European Commission has the chance to change that with its broad economic guidelines .
I seriously suggest to the Commission that it looks very carefully at the recommendations in the Cassidy report because when that report is voted tomorrow in this House it will win a substantial majority across all the political groups .
Let us look at the detail .
Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the mix between monetary policy and fiscal policy .
Inflation is now at historically low levels .
We accept that we have to have price stability .
But why do we have this preoccupation with such tight monetary policy and fiscal policy at a time when we have such historically low levels of inflation .
There has to be a better balance between monetary policy and fiscal policy in the European Union .
The broad economic guidelines should recognize that .
We must try to get short-term interest rates down .
This House accepts that to deal with currency fluctuations we have to try to reach the goal of economic and monetary union .
There is no doubt about that . We are fully behind the Commission on that .
But we have to recognize that we have to gain public confidence for this project .
We talk about a crisis of confidence . Of course there is a crisis of confidence .
You need only look at the people , for example in Germany , France and Spain who do not known what is going to happen to the social muddle of their economy .
They do not know what is going to happen to their social benefits because governments are using EMU as an excuse to cut the social programmes .
We need to have mediumterm budget programmes and proposals and that should be highlighted in the Commission 's broad economic guidelines .
We need to give people some certainty and some transparency about what governments are planning for the next two to three years .
Where are the flanking measures to bring about retraining and investment that is necessary to give consumers confidence for the future ?
Lastly , on the issue of investment : we cannot sacrifice public investment in the name of fiscal consolidation .
That is a short-term political goal and it will lead to the destruction of further confidence in Europe 's economy .
Although there is generally great diversity in this Parliament , there is in fact unanimity that the creation of jobs is the principal economic , political and social objective of this Union .
It is important that we have the right guidelines which will be conducive to investment and job creation .
If we are to achieve this objective , a wide variety of measures are very urgently needed .
The slowdown was also aided by moderation of investment , export growth and low levels of consumption .
As one who comes from a peripheral rural constituency I appreciate the importance of a proper and adequate infrastructure .
We must have confidence in the economy .
I believe that 1999 cannot come quickly enough because the single currency will play an important role .
In the meantime we must ensure that there is greater currency stability .
Economic growth must be generated by the market and the private sector .
We must look very closely at this and we must remember that the engine of growth in the economy is largely the private sector .
The fundamental problems of the European economic and social muddle must be tackled urgently to stabilize the rate of employment if not reverse it .
There are good points in the resolution on the 1996 Annual Economic Report .
Nevertheless there are three issues which need to be raised .
Time does not permit me to do this now but I hope I will have an opportunity later to discuss it with Mr Cassidy .
Mr Donnelly in his contribution said he was waiting for the Santer Commission to deliver better not just less .
I would suggest that in some respects that is like waiting for Godot .
This is not a criticism of the Commission but reflects the scale of the intervention possibilities open to it .
This debate is happening at two levels .
The critical level , in terms of real force and substance , lies at the level of Member States .
If we look at our respective Member State budgets , they range each year between 40 % and 70 % of GDP .
The EU budget , as an instrument of economic policy , amounts to 1.25 % of European GDP .
All the measures the Commission is talking about in a confidence pact - and so far as they go , they are welcome - are still very small in relation even to the EU budget .
They amount to about 1 % of that budget and therefore to about one hundredth of 1 % of EU GDP .
This brings me back to the guidelines exercise . There we are at the coal-face with the Member States and what they can deliver .
The fact is that we have a huge labour surplus in Europe but we are putting so much tax on labour .
We all recognize the need to start shifting away from direct taxes on labour .
These are the instruments of policy that one wants to see as part of a vigorous approach to the broad economic guidelines exercise .
On the issue of the European social model I frankly confess I do not know what it is .
Given what I said about the GDP shares of public sector in our Member States , I know what it is not .
It is not what we think the US social model is and that is about as well as I can define it .
I know this much about how we characterize what happens in the United States .
We have converted and degenerated some of their employment creation capacity into a view that it is all fast-food economy .
It is not .
Two-thirds of their high-quality service sector jobs are in insurance , banking , finance , Silicon Valley , software .
That is the kind of space we need to build into our European economic model , into our social model and not let some cosy consensus by way of social modelling ruin our economic potential and possibilities .
In any case , reality has shown that those who dared to make such a forecast have been proved right .
Mr President , there is a well-known saying about swings and roundabouts .
Whereas last year Parliament placed the emphasis on growth and progress towards economic and monetary union , now the text is dominated by the unemployment problem .
But there is one point of agreement .
Both reports on economic policy confirm the impression that environment policy is only a stepchild .
It is time for the economists in this House to see that economy and environment are twins .
How can we concentrate on the enormous unemployment problem , which is indeed a real one , whilst closing our eyes to the ongoing deterioration of the environment ?
Then we simply forget a very important item in our European housekeeping book .
And good economists know that in the long run that ends up in bankruptcy .
The two may very well go together as moreover Parliament has said previously .
In that respect I might make an appeal to the unexpressed wish of every Member of Parliament , namely to achieve consistency of views .
The aim of achieving greater economic growth is central in this report .
There is a danger there , namely that we might lose sight of the idea that economic growth is nothing more than one of the means of promoting citizens ' welfare and well-being .
There are environmental conditions and social boundaries which economic development must observe in order to be lasting .
Economic growth cannot manage without these boundaries because the boundless and the measureless is not an environment in which mankind can live .
Our quest for welfare must have certain limits , otherwise it will go wrong from the outset .
So let us strive for sustainable economic development .
The economic situation of the European Union is determined by an increasing structural problem .
Instead of a reduction in unemployment , reduced growth will lead to an increase in unemployment .
The main reason for this development lies in the declining competitiveness of the EU Member States ' economies in relation to other regions such as the United States or Asia .
This also manifests itself in the fall in direct investments by companies from the OECD states or from the United States and Japan in Europe , a decrease which has been quite dramatic in some cases .
Europe is feeling the pinch and is becoming less and less attractive as a business location .
If we look at the way in which the political leaders of the European Union have been focusing primarily on economic and monetary union , it is surely reasonable to speak of the EU having its priorities wrong .
The annual economic report certainly highlights this situation .
The Commission must tackle the acute unresolved problems .
I can cite the failure to promote research and development in the European Union with anything like the required vigour .
After all , it is new information technology , newly developed technological innovations , which are the main generators of economic growth and diminishing unemployment outside Europe , particularly in the United States and Asia .
We look in vain for measures to reduce these indirect costs , especially for the lower-paid and on the taxation side .
This means on the one hand that companies are deterred from engaging new staff and on the other hand that confidence in Europe as a location is dwindling .
That is why we must act quickly , but most especially in the Member States .
This shows that he has cast himself free from certain restraints , something which I respect and would like to welcome .
Mr President , our problem at this time is that we want to create the single currency .
That is the next great step in the building of Europe .
But economic circumstances are making it difficult , and are doing that because of the familiar reasons of slowing down economic activity and increasing unemployment .
We must first stress that the single currency is not responsible for unemployment . Unemployment came before it .
We must also stress that progress towards the single currency must not worsen the situation in that respect .
It is more likely that such a psychological reaction would come as the result of long term stabilization , but this long term stabilization and its psychological result may take five or ten years to come about .
What we are interested in is something much more immediate , and we do not have it at this time .
Mr President , we are asked to consider the example of the United States and the elastic labour market .
Nobody has mentioned the sacrifice of profits by Japanese companies so that they could avoid making people redundant when Japan 's economy was in its deepest recession .
It is time we recognized that unemployment is ultimately a distribution problem , the distribution of income and wealth .
And there is enough margin in the profit structure of European companies , from what the Commission 's own report and Mr Cassidy 's report tell us .
Commissioner , under the umbrella of fighting unemployment you spoke of cutting the deficits .
You spoke of the single currency and structural measures .
As we have said , all this can have an effect in the long term .
You did not say anything about the new framework for macroeconomic policy , the need to balance financial discipline with a more flexible monetary policy .
The only crumb of a new macroeconomic approach you offered us is the transEuropean networks .
Mr von Wogau expressed himself with irony on the point that the debts could enable us to create jobs .
He could equally well be asked whether he knows where unemployment in Europe would be now if European countries had refused to go into debt when the oil crisis struck .
Mr President , we were told that nobody knows what the European social model is supposed to be .
The problem is how to get back to those times .
And we will certainly not do that by setting up the single currency , a Shylock which will demand the payment of debts in the flesh of Europe 's working people .
Because the single currency will then risk sharing Shylock 's fate and that of his bill of exchange .
Of all of these of greatest economic importance and social consequence is the problem of unemployment , in relation to which there are positions to be taken which cannot be delayed .
It is today unquestionable that growth and job-creation are being made difficult by the rigour imposed in respect of fulfilling the Maastricht criteria .
It is unacceptable that there should be such moves of entrenchment as it seems that a given criterion takes on more or less importance according to those who fail to meet with them .
The Commission 's 1996 Annual Economic Report , which is the subject of Mr Cassidy 's report , presents a view of the Union 's economy which is certainly not encouraging .
In the second place unemployment , as has also been said here throughout the evening , is continuing at unacceptably high levels .
The conclusion to be drawn from this overview is that something is lacking in the theoretical reasoning of recent times .
According to the recent frequentlyrepeated analysis , growth should occur as a natural consequence of the policy of stability and rationalization of the fundamentals of the economy .
Reality shows us on the other hand that in spite of rationalization of the basic macroeconomic imbalances , the expected growth and above all the creation of enough jobs are not taking place .
This is what the Commission calls the ' paradox of the lack of confidence ' , in spite of the favourable economic fundamentals .
But the trend of economic recovery stopped with household consumption , with workers ' consumption - still at low levels - particularly as regards consumption of durable goods .
The increase in the GDP in 1994 and 1995 was converted , in the case of household economies , into savings and not into a recovery of consumption levels .
This very afternoon Commissioner de Silguy , in his opening speech , told us that to tackle the present situation it was impossible to deny the need to deal with the question of social protection .
Naturally one must agree with that .
Social protection needs to be reformed in order to preserve social protection .
In the third place I should like to stress the need for a less strict monetary policy .
That too has been discussed here this evening .
Mr President , work , sustainable long-range economic development and good quality of life are important values for us as individuals .
However , these values must be included in the balance of economic welfare variables , otherwise they become a residual item .
When a market is integrated solely in response to the dictates of the economy , other human values are downgraded .
Eighteen to twenty million EU citizens are currently without work .
Without such stated aims , EMU becomes an obstacle to positive development , posing the threat of an increase in unemployment , environmental degradation and regional imbalance .
As long as such wrong priorities determine the future of the EU , confidence in European cooperation will also be low .
Mr President , I want to say something about Amendment No 15 , which says that general tax reductions do not bring down unemployment .
I have tabled this motion , because too much confidence is placed in the positive effects of tax reductions .
Economic studies have shown that , in the OECD for example , there is no link between the level of tax in a country and economic growth .
Taxes are not theft ; they represent something that is given back to the citizens , either in the form of pensions and sickness insurance or in the form of services provided in the public sector .
Paragraph 23 conveys a certain surprise that public expenditure in the Union amounts to around 50 % of GDP .
General tax reductions do not solve any problems .
What usually happens is that the distribution of incomes becomes more uneven , which in its turn leads to reduced demand , since those on high incomes will save more .
My view is that the EU needs lower taxes least of all .
We need better schools , universities and hospitals .
We need more cultural institutions , upgraded ports and roads .
A strong public sector with a well developed social insurance system is the surest way to strengthen people 's confidence in the future .
Lower taxes create more problems than they solve .
First , let me answer a few of the specific questions asked , especially by your rapporteur .
You complain that we have provided no statistics for 1996 .
Do not worry , Mr Cassidy , those are the rules of the game .
The Annual Economic Report will provide you with all the 1996-1997 projections , together with the guidelines , but at present those projections have not yet been finalized by the Commission .
It is true that there is no analysis of regional disparities , but this is not the purpose of the Annual Economic Report .
There is a regular report on regional policy which answers your question .
As regards wages and non-wage labour costs , the matter was dealt with on pages 53 onwards of the Annual Economic Report , and I would refer you to those pages .
Here again , you will find all the appropriate observations in the Annual Economic Report .
Now , if I may , I would like to say something by way of winding up this debate .
Mr Donnelly and Mr Pérez Royo are right : there is a paradox in the present situation .
I maintain that the economic fundamentals are good , even very good , and yet economic activity is flat and unemployment is at an intolerable level .
I would say that this problem cannot be solved by giving up .
But the only way to create the necessary conditions for the creation of jobs is to restore confidence .
There will be no jobs without confidence , and confidence requires two things , two main conditions : the reduction of public deficits and an end to monetary turbulence .
Why should public deficits be reduced ?
How do you expect investors to have a sufficiently clear view if they know that the burdens weighing on public budgets are excessive ?
How do you expect consumers not to over-save unless they have reason to believe that taxes are going to come down ?
As far as monetary turbulence is concerned , I would remind you that according to our estimates the fluctuations of 1995 cost Europe half a point 's growth in 1995 and 1996 .
That is why economic and monetary union is an essential , indispensable condition for the creation of jobs .
Now , the matter of employment .
No one can say today that Europe is costing jobs .
Without Europe , we would have much greater unemployment .
After all , net job creation in Europe in 1995 totalled 800 , 000 .
Without Europe , that figure could certainly not have been achieved .
You will tell me , of course , that in the United States eight million jobs have been created in the last two years .
I would ask this : are we willing to abandon our social system , our European social protection models , to go looking for other models ?
I would say , philosophically as it were , that this is actually a point worth considering .
That was why the Commission presented its White Paper in 1993 .
That was why the European Council in Essen adopted a set of priorities .
But in this case , there is no escaping the fact that responsibility lies firstly , and essentially , with the Member States .
Nevertheless , we can use the lever of the Community to facilitate and support job creation .
That was why President Santer presented his confidence pact .
The Round Table which was held a few days ago in Brussels marked the starting signal for a fruitful dialogue .
The next task is to prepare for the European Council in Florence , because that is the level at which the decisions are going to have to be taken .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
Boatmasters ' certificates
So the Committee on Transport can vote for those parts of the common position .
With regard to some four other matters , however , the Committee on Transport maintains its original viewpoint .
That applies in the first place to job experience .
According to the common position the required experience of an applicant for a boatmaster 's certificate may in certain circumstances be reduced by a maximum of three years .
In the Commission proposal , with which Parliament agreed , that reduction could not exceed two years .
The Committee on Transport was astonished that the Council took this approach .
The Commission mentions as one of the objectives of this directive the need to step up the safety requirements .
That objective is certainly not served by the common position .
What is more , a distinction is created with the requirements of the Rhine navigation licence for which the maximum deductible in respect of experience is still limited to two years .
The second feature which the Committee on Transport wishes to retain is the comparability of examination requirements in the Member States .
The competent authorities of the Member States would then have to exchange ideas now and then through the intermediary of the Commission .
It is not clear why this proposal has not been accepted .
As the third point I should like to say that Member States must not be enabled lightly to impose supplementary requirements on boatmasters for navigating particular waterways .
For that the Commission 's approval needs to be given .
We do not think it is sufficient to consult the Commission as proposed by the Council .
Then one more point about medical examination of boatmasters over the age of 65 .
The Committee on Transport thinks , in accordance with the Commission proposal , that intervals of three years are sufficient .
We do not think there are any convincing arguments for the annual examination chosen by the Council .
That is a new amendment not included in first reading and which , I have heard , has meanwhile been declared inadmissible .
Possibly the Commission can go further into this question in bilateral contact with the countries concerned .
I should be glad to have the Commissioner 's views on this .
To sum up , the Committee on Transport is concerned to retain a number of matters which were mostly already contained in the Commission proposal .
We expect therefore that the Commission will continue to give them strong support in the subsequent stages .
Mr President , I hope that remark of yours is duly recorded and will be illuminated in neon signs outside Parliament .
It will do our reputation a great deal of good .
I can scarcely contain my emotion in responding to the fine speech from Mr van der Waal especially since this is a debate which has obviously attracted such extensive interest .
It provides for a single national boatmaster 's certificate conferred on the basis of harmonized conditions and drawn up in accordance with a Community model which is mutually recognized by Member States .
The Commission therefore accepted amendments proposed by Council and I now seek Parliament 's approval of the common position which , despite our current divergencies , I hope it will give on further reflection .
My colleagues in the Commission and I have naturally given thorough attention to the amendments tabled by the Transport Committee in this second reading .
Furthermore , as is generally the case , the choice of testing procedures must remain with Member States .
Amendment No 3 proposes that medical examinations of boatmasters over the age of 65 should be at three-year intervals .
For safety reasons the Council considered that boatmasters aged 65 and over should be required to undergo an annual medical examination .
This is a sensible provision and the Commission has consequently accepted the Council 's view .
On the question of required professional experience , the original Commission text preserved parallelism with the Rhine navigation licence and that is proposed as Parliament 's Amendment No 4 .
The Commission accepts that provision for prior consultation as proposed by the Council will in reality be sufficient to achieve the same purpose .
Mr President , I should like to put two further points to the Commissioner .
In the first place I should like to remind him that the amendments which the Committee on Transport has retained were mainly amendments which were originally in the Commission proposal .
I understand that the Commissioner has now accepted the compromise in the Council on these points .
But I think we in the Committee on Transport still wonder whether the Commissioner has not accepted the Council 's ideas too quickly .
My second point concerns the actual question of Amendment No 2 .
I said myself that it had been declared inadmissible by the presidency .
Possibly the Commissioner can confirm that he will make bilateral contact with the Member States concerned on this matter .
I am grateful to him for facilitating the work by so readily accepting the inadmissibility of that proposal .
Nevertheless , the principle that he would seek to sustain will be sustained .
We reached the conclusion , which we can easily sustain , that the proposals were adequately covered by the means I suggested .
There is no antagonism in the position we take .
For that reason I am sure Parliament might be inclined on reflection to welcome the attitude I have expressed on behalf of the Commission .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
Motor vehicle pollution
Basically , it has long been a thing of the past , because it is already being implemented in all its aspects .
There are many different reasons why it has been tabled so late , and I do not propose to enumerate them all .
Suffice to say that this is the final step under EURO II , at a time when discussions in the corridors and elsewhere have already turned to EURO III .
In particular , there are no tax incentives to introduce even higher standards .
These were not endorsed by the Council .
Directives , of course , are adopted jointly by Parliament and the Council and not by the Council alone .
I assume that the Council will eventually manage to learn that lesson .
The second amendment relates to Article 2 and seeks to reverse the exemption granted in respect of low-powered light commercial vehicles .
I hope that the Commission will help here and that this question will not drag us into the codecision procedure .
Light commercial vehicles will continue to demand our attention in the future , of course , for one thing because they are to some extent hybrids .
Passenger-car engines are built into larger chassis and the vehicles are used primarily in our inner cities .
As a result , they account for quite a considerable amount of inner-city pollution .
Since these vehicles essentially have passenger-car engines , we seek the same values as apply to passenger cars .
That has also been achieved in Group I .
I could imagine that at the stage beginning in 2000 vehicles in Groups I and II will be given at least the same values as passenger cars .
Which brings me to the 2000 stage .
I sincerely hope that the phase beginning in 2000 will be finalized , at least for passenger cars , by the end of this month and presented to Parliament .
To this end , a number of directives have previously lowered the thresholds for emissions of certain toxic gases - carbon monoxide and non-burned hydrocarbons - originating from petrol and diesel engines .
The standards have been applied to all private vehicles , irrespective of their engine capacity .
In conclusion , therefore , we shall be voting against the rapporteur 's Amendment No 2 , but we shall be in favour of Amendments Nos 1 and 3 .
Mr President , this is in second reading and it is a codecision procedure , so Parliament has some authority with regard to this proposal .
In first reading we tabled 18 amendments and the Commission has adopted only four of them .
But fortunately the Council was more progressive .
That has meant a tightening up of the Commission 's original proposal with regard to emission standards .
So once again the Council enhances a proposal whilst the Commission to some extent mars it .
But in any case we are now at the point for Parliament to deal with this in second reading .
Why should we extend it by one year ?
For those reasons we as Parliament must strive for strict standards which compel the industry to invest in the development of clean technology .
Naturally we shall vote also for the two other amendments .
Following the Maastricht Treaty the European Parliament must be consulted , as we have made clear in Amendments Nos 1 and 3 .
I should like to end with one question to the Commission .
I should be glad to have an answer from the Commission to this question with regard to dates .
This has led our fellow-Member to think it more appropriate to remain in Germany .
All this is particularly important for us , but may cause inconvenience for some colleagues .
In fact the amendments already approved by Parliament contained more advanced suggestions which we should certainly have preferred .
I think also , for reasons of compatibility with the rest of Europe and the need for industrial competitiveness , that all industries must be able to respect Community rules without exception .
Mr President , I am sorry that the rapporteur could not be here .
That is also the reason why we have a last remnant , as it were , to see to here , as Mr Lange rightly said , which brings me to the amendments .
In short , of course these proposals can be accepted , and they will result in the appropriate amendments being made .
The substance of Amendment No 2 , which Mr Lange mentioned , poses no problems for the Commission either .
However , I do not know whether the Council sees this in the same light , and that is precisely where our doubts begin to emerge .
The worst thing that can happen to us is that the Council will refuse to deal with the new proposals until the present one is adopted .
So I crave the indulgence of Mr Lange and the European Parliament when I say the following to you here . The substance of the amendment does not give us any problems .
If the Council has no problems with it either , we shall advocate its adoption there .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
( The sitting was suspended at 8 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
Capital adequacy of financial institutions
Mr President , my report is concerned with setting up a committee of experts which the Commission will consult with .
In the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights there has been no real problem with the substance of the Commission proposal . Most of the discussion has centred around the procedure to be followed .
I congratulate my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights for their tenacity in demanding that a fast-track approach was not appropriate in this situation .
I and my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights feel that democratic principles demand the maximum involvement of the European Parliament .
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights wishes the committee which is to be set up to be in a form that enhances the democratic accountability of this committee .
In the amendment to Article 1 we say that the Commission should consult with the Council after the committee has given its view .
In our view it is wrong democratically for legislation to be made without the involvement of the Council and Parliament .
The issue therefore is one of comitology .
In this case we have proposed that the Council acting by qualified majority can take a different decision .
That is why my committee insisted on having a full debate here in Brussels and a proper report and proper vote .
I am informed that there are situations where the Commission can set up a committee which can change legislation without even referring to the Council .
I do not think the public would find this acceptable .
This is the minimum standard of democracy that can be acceptable and I thank my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights for insisting on this .
Mr President , my group would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent report .
As she has so rightly said , the report and the amendments to it go to the heart of the decision-making procedure in this field and democratic accountability .
The amendments are especially important .
The Group of the European People 's Party are very concerned that in the spirit of openness we should restrict the room for manoeuvre by the Council and have more transparency .
British Conservatives and the whole of the Group of the European People 's Party are particularly concerned that there should be more openness .
The Commissioner in his observations may like to comment as to the degree of openness and accountability we would like to see as far as the electors are concerned .
We would prefer the Commission to come before Parliament and , in conjunction with the Council , set out how the decisions were going to be taken .
In these and similar cases , it was small savers and ordinary taxpayers who suffered .
Since what was involved here was mainly speculation on a supranational scale , it is easier to accept controls in respect of these matters than in many other fields .
As regards the relationship between the Commission 's and the Legal Affairs Committee 's proposals , the differences do not appear that great , either on matters of principle or in practical respects .
Hence we also support the report .
We are very glad that Parliament has given its approval to this initiative .
The new committee will take up duty alongside the Banking Advisory Committee and the Insurance Committee : we shall thus have all the committees needed to see that the single market in securities operates properly .
In the second place the new committee will have an advisory role .
Representatives of the Member States and the Commission will be able to exchange views on developments on the securities markets .
I must , however , say , unfortunately , that the Commission cannot accept Parliament 's proposal to arrange for the committee to work according to type IIB procedure rather than type IIIA .
In our view there is no reason for giving the securities committee the power to take urgent decisions as type IIB procedure allows .
That is a procedure which is appropriate rather for a management committee , for example in the agriculture sector .
For that reason , therefore , the Commission can only reject Amendments Nos 1 , 3 and 4 .
I hope Parliament will be able to support our point of view on this problem so as to present a joint position to the Council in future discussions in order to get the type IIIA procedure through .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
HIV / AIDS in developing countries
Mr President , it is a pity that the rapporteur is not here .
I also take the liberty of adding a few comments of my own .
In the context of the HIV problem , it is important to focus attention on any tendencies to heightened and negative attitudes towards homosexuality and homosexual individuals .
Certainly , the HIV virus in no way spares heterosexuals but , in spite of everything , it has often been associated in public perceptions with homosexuality and homosexuals .
There are disquieting reports , from countries such as Zimbabwe for example , of tendencies to increased discrimination against homosexuals .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our Group supports the report drawn up by Mrs André-Léonard because we think she has the right approach .
I think it is important in this case that it is the Committee on Development Cooperation which has itself seen that there should be a report about this .
It is naturally entirely bound up with the fact that 90 % of those with HIV infections are in developing countries .
But we thought we ought to table amendments on a number of points , not because basically we want to detract from the report but because we think that one or two points are not taken far enough .
On the whole we are very satisfied with the report .
Mr President , I am sorry that Mrs André-Léonard is not here , because we would like to congratulate her on her report , with its frank and humane approach and its respect for human rights .
I think it is important to stress that .
Still , we do have the Commissioner and his colleagues here , and they at least will be able to hear what we have to say .
The Commission has already done a great deal in this area , and the presentation of this proposal for a Regulation is just one element of a concerted action undertaken by the Commission over several years .
It was not easy at the start .
There are a lot of preconceived notions , cultural obstacles and difficulties of how to approach these very sensitive problems that have to be overcome before any effective action can be instituted on the ground .
It was important to emphasize that .
As I am short of time , let me finish by saying that within the Committee on Women 's Rights we laid particular emphasis on two things .
First , there is the matter of children .
We really must pay special attention to them , especially in terms of prevention , because they are particularly vulnerable targets .
Many of these children are living as orphans in villages where there is no one left to take care of them except the elderly .
The Committee on Women 's Rights emphasizes this point .
Secondly , I believe that women are extremely important in all preventive schemes , not only in themselves but also because many of them are concerned with health care .
They are often behind the provision of primary health care and local activities .
Frequently , too , they act as midwives , who can achieve a great deal in terms of prevention .
Mrs André-Léonard made this point in her report and in the amendments we drafted , and I wanted to emphasize it here .
Mr President , I must apologize , I was at a working meeting and did not realize my report had already been called .
Sadly , poverty and the danger of infection with AIDS go hand in hand .
We need to act quickly , because the fight to prevent the propagation of the epidemic is truly a race against the clock .
The number of people infected with the HIV virus today is estimated at 17 million .
In 1986 , the WHO set up a global programme to combat AIDS .
Europe picked up the baton in 1987 and 1988 .
The programme has been extended to all the developing countries .
It is nearly 10 years since the international community intervened to try to limit the effects of the epidemic .
Various lessons have been learned over that period to suggest different lines of approach for the future .
In May 1994 , the Council of Development Ministers adopted a resolution in this area .
That is why this assistance programme must , first and foremost , be a priority one , having regard to the endemic nature of the epidemic .
Hitherto , the available resources have been inadequate , and that is deplorable .
A fortiori , then , they have to be exclusively devoted to prevention .
The inadequacy of funding is a guiding theme of European development policy , although Europe is in fact the primary source of funding for development aid .
If a new drug were to be developed to combat this disease , its exorbitant price would not allow us to treat millions of HIV-positive individuals in the third world .
Prevention has to be aimed primarily at the poorest strata of society and the target and at-risk groups which react most to this type of campaign and adjust their behaviour .
Information on sexual hygiene is mainly associated with the advice given to mothers and young girls .
But it should also be aimed at the male half of the population .
The effectiveness of the programme depends not only on a genuine political commitment at all levels and active collaboration between all those involved but also on a considerable increase in resources .
The Commission , however , had reasserted to the ACP countries that the necessary resources would be committed to face up to the problems .
I am sorry to say that , sadly , the budget is very tight .
The Council , in its resolution of 6 May 1994 , acknowledged that it would be necessary to top up the resources , if appropriate by re-itemizing the budget .
AIDS is a particularly heavy burden to be borne by the health services in many developing countries .
We need to help to stem the epidemic by adopting a strategy which takes account of the problems associated with under-development , such as poverty , overpopulation and malnutrition .
The lack of education is mainly responsible for these scourges .
Finally , I wanted to associate the prevention of AIDS with the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases .
In order to avoid the increased propagation of the virus , and also of other diseases that can be transmitted through the blood , it is essential to improve hygiene standards in transfusion centres in the Third World .
Otherwise , any prevention is doomed to failure .
These results are genuinely encouraging , and should persuade the European Union to increase its budget in order to put an end to this worldwide AIDS epidemic .
If I may , I would like to stress the impressive work performed by the non-governmental organizations - which the Union , incidentally , is supporting with all its strength .
These NGOs , through their awareness campaigns on the ground , are able to influence the most vulnerable sectors of the population .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on Development and Cooperation has been particularly touched and pleased , at the same time , by the results that have been achieved .
For all the reasons that have just been stated , it is not easy to summarize such a vast problem as briefly as any summary should .
It is true that we have done a great deal , but there is so much left to do .
There are two points , at least , to which I would like to call honourable Members ' attention .
First , basic care is not sufficiently developed .
We are not talking about research or other things of that kind , we are talking about basics .
I think Mrs André-Léonard failed to stress it sufficiently , perhaps out of modesty .
We have tried to institute - and it will take all the Commission 's efforts - a system which will be fairer towards the developing countries .
Everyone said immediately that this would be impossible in the developing countries .
They will no longer be able to receive treatment because these very advances move treatment farther out of their reach .
They are too expensive .
That was the thinking behind our work on the Committee on Development and Cooperation , and I am very grateful to Mrs André-Léonard for having enabled this work to be done .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the report she has put before us .
I believe the report strikes a good balance between various ideas here in Parliament , and it outlines an approach with which we can go part of the way towards solving the problem .
I believe that , as with the Schmid report that we adopted some time ago on the same subject , a pragmatic approach has been selected here which can come to grips with the problem .
We have tended not to immerse ourselves in ideologies in this committee , preferring to tackle the issue in a pragmatic manner .
That means on the one hand that the Catholic Church , for example , cannot be made responsible for the occurrence of AIDS in developing countries .
There are many causes , above all grinding poverty , lack of information and lack of basic education .
On the other hand , however , it means that there should be no attempt in any way to prevent the use of condoms because of blinkered ideological beliefs .
Perhaps it is actually better to set about the cost-effective provision of safe condoms in some other manner , but I believe this option should be thoroughly examined again .
We should do everything possible to get the problem under control , including the use of this method .
Our group , then , is in favour of the report in principle .
We merely have certain reservations about particular amendments .
For that reason I am not sure whether the amendment should be adopted in its present wording or whether that would give rise to misunderstandings .
The amendment refers to a solidarity fund that is to be provided by bodies such as the UN .
I do not think the idea can be presented in this manner , and the substance of this amendment surely requires further intensive discussion .
For that reason , I believe this amendment should not be supported here either .
Otherwise this report contains extremely good proposals , and we should adopt it tomorrow by the largest possible majority .
I thank Mrs André-Léonard once again for the work she has done , and ask the whole House to support this report .
Mrs André-Léonard , since you were away at the time , I must tell you that all your colleagues who spoke expressed their esteem for the quality of your work .
An important issue , as Mr Kouchner said , except that we began with only two people here !
Ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank the House for the interest it has shown in this matter and in particular to Mrs André-Léonard for a report which we think is excellent .
According to United Nations estimates , around 20 million people around the world have been infected with the HIV virus and we are still seeing an exponential increase in the epidemic in most countries .
Around 90 % of persons infected live in developing countries and , within this group , about two-thirds live in Africa .
However , the rapid increase in new cases in Asia tends to point to the fact that , at the turn of the century , it is in this continent that most HIV positive people will live .
Unlike most other infections , as has already been said , AIDS mostly is propagated between young populations , active people , those at the age of procreation .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
Environmental measures in developing countries
Mr President , Commissioner , if I may be allowed to correct the interpretation , the phrase is ' sustainable development ' .
To arrive at this , let us consider a few essential indicators .
This , then , confronts us with two questions . What can we do to mitigate this phenomenon , and what can we do if we fail to find a way of mitigating it ?
The third indicator : the coastal , terrestrial and marine ecosystems are becoming increasingly fragile ; in the absence of scientific certainties , the principle of safety first must be given priority .
The fourth indicator : the scientific issue of biodiversity is almost as important as the political , cultural and economic issues .
The rate at which these species are disappearing is incompletely understood , as are the effects on nature and on man .
These facts constitute a strong argument in favour of a voluntary policy of ecosystem preservation .
However , in order to see each aspect in its true light , it is appropriate to recall the terms of Principle No 1 of the Rio declaration on the environment and development .
Concerns relating to sustainable development focus on human beings . They have a right to a healthy and productive life , in harmony with nature .
These points having been established , the slenderness of budget line B7-6200 imposes upon us the second methodological requirement . First , we need to define the features of this budget line .
Then we need to incorporate it into the additionality of the other financial instruments directed towards the environment and development .
She has outlined the background , defined the priorities and pointed to what I think is essential for managing this budget line .
I should like to send just two or three messages to the Commissioner - whom I greet - and the Commission . The first is the budget for this project .
I must say that the values mentioned , 13 to 15 million Ecus , are far too low .
We in the European Parliament proposed a minimum amount of 50 million ECUs and this really is the minimum amount .
The second comment concerns flexibility in adopting such projects . Until now this has been the approach followed by the Commission and we have backed this .
At least so far this has been avoided .
That is why in the future this flexibility and operational capacity must be maintained .
Thirdly , I refer to the role of NGOs and communities .
Mr President , we would like to congratulate Mrs TaubiraDelannon and to endorse everything she proposes in this report on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
I believe this is an extremely important approach , one which gives the true meaning to the programme that we are trying to defend through this Regulation .
The first is water , which really is the crucial element for tomorrow .
It will be one of the most costly commodities in our societies , and one of the most difficult to obtain .
It is an essential element of human life , not just because we consume it but because it is also a factor in health care .
I believe it is important that this should be one of the priorities we defend .
Secondly , there is energy .
Energy causes pollution , energy costs a lot of money , energy is a dependency factor for groups of people .
That is why any development of renewable energy sources and solar energy is important in this programme .
To conclude , Mr President , as regards the protagonists of environmental protection and sustainable development , the local populations and basic organizations are indeed essential .
The issue here is not the encouragement of consultancy bureaux , important though they are .
It is important that knowledge should be recognized before any action is taken , but it remains true that the local population must be at the centre of the development of these programmes .
I would also like to mention one aspect which has not yet been stressed .
We are well aware that rivers and forests recognize no frontiers , so that all action taken must be more on regional than national lines .
Finally , we echo the thought expressed by Mr Pimenta : resources , resources , resources - they are never sufficient to achieve ambitions , our ambitions and our commitment at international level .
This is a problem which concerns us all , the sinews of our war .
I hope the comments we shall make and the support we are giving this report will help to develop programmes which seem to us to be of the greatest importance .
Something simply has to change here .
The climatic disaster will come if nothing changes , and changes have to be made soon .
The developing countries will be hit far harder by such a disaster than we .
It will be bad enough for Europe .
It will be worse for the developing countries because desertification hits them hardest .
This aspect is addressed in the Taubira report , but many other important points are raised there too .
Let me mention Amendment No 36 , which I believe to be very important .
It must be a distinctly environmental programme and not a damage-limitation programme for ecocidal projects .
That is precisely why I have problems with Amendment No 21 , which could be misleading in this respect .
I have problems - and so does my group - with Amendment No 48 , which calls for aid to be focused on biosphere reserves and similar areas .
I believe that we really have to view this problem from a global perspective and that concentrating the environmental protection effort on reserves is not the answer ; the environment must be protected everywhere .
But I think there are only a few points of disagreement .
The priorities are clear .
We must cooperate internationally , and this should include UN initiatives .
If that applies to AIDS , it must also apply to the environment , which is why I consider it important that we should coordinate this programme with the efforts of international institutions too .
We must also remember the Lomé Convention , Regulation No 443 / 92 on the agreements with Latin America and Asia and also the agreement with the Mediterranean countries , the Mashreq and the Maghreb countries .
They all emphasize environmental conservation .
The rapporteur 's report stresses areas for priority action already mentioned by other speakers : preserving biological diversity , improvement of the urban environment , preservation of coastal areas and the like .
There is also an amendment closely related to the present situation as regards meetings in this Parliament .
It is Amendment No 28 which , at least in the Spanish version , refers to prior consent of the indigenous peoples when they are affected by pilot projects .
I have always said that Community law is amongst the most advanced in the world if we were able to see that it was enforced .
Each year 's annual report on the implementation of Community allows us all to see that perhaps Community law related to the environment is the least implemented .
Mr President , this draft legislation combines two aims .
The budget line itself , however , which was created at the height of the Rio debate , has been cut from 50 million to 15 million in the 1996 budget .
I regard this as a shameful amount , too clearly indicative of neglect .
I do not believe we should finance expensive studies in western countries for projects in the developing world ; we should do far better to support specific projects in the field .
We should recognize what this funding cut means .
It begs the question whether Rio was a lot of hot air about nothing .
The amount cited here is really and truly a pittance .
I do not think it is anything for us to crow about .
Finally , let me say that this report will have our unanimous support .
Mr President , during the last few months this report has been one of the most important along with the one we have just spoken about .
This cooperation is reflected in Amendment No 3 in which we ask for a stocking-up of the budget by the year 2000 to ECU 50m .
Secondly , there was also disagreement . Working in politics often involves disagreements .
We disagreed about Amendment No 8 and I feel sorry that this amendment was not passed .
Mr Pimenta argues that we should have a division in which a special aspect of the environment should be targeted , for example to begin with the ecosystems .
One could argue that this is not very useful for the Commission to work with because it is not always clear but it should be seen as a warning .
Others have said the same in the context of biodiversity .
Biodiversity is not only a case of protecting the third world it is also an important issue for the future of all humankind .
We all know that our future medicines and food are in biodiversity .
If we lose the biodiversity we are losing our future .
That is why Mr Pimenta was fighting for this division and we should debate that again .
Secondly , integration . This has been talked about by many speakers already .
In that area I wish to support Amendment No 21 by Mr Liese .
In my view this amendment is saying that this budget line should not be used where the normal budget lines in other fields could also take the environment into account .
This one should be used for pilot projects .
In that way the environment will automatically be included in other budget lines .
That is what we are discussing at present with DG XI of the Commission and its fifth environment action programme .
The biggest problem of the whole idea of environment is implementation and integration .
Integration in the first place has to start with development .
It is also relevant of course in economic affairs , the internal market , transport , energy policy and so on but development is perhaps the most important field .
That is why we should integrate .
I will give you one example - social policies towards street children in Brazil .
For the future unemployment and the huge population growth is a ticking timebomb .
This could be a future issue .
Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur for this report and also thank the Commission for the proposals in the first place .
When we discuss developing countries we normally do so in a situation of crisis such as famine , civil strife or full-scale war .
For example , huge tracts of mature forests are being cut away without any provision whatsoever for replanting or preparation of the land for other useful purposes .
I believe the level of funding - and this point has already been made by others - is far less than sufficient , bearing in mind the magnitude of the problem .
A regulatory regime must be imposed on foreign companies forcing them to replant the areas they have clear-felled and generally making a serious effort to reinstate where damage is done .
Ladies and gentlemen , it is perhaps a platitude to say that sustainable development is a challenge for all of us .
Environmental problems continue to get worse in developing and industrialised countries alike .
One example of this is the content of the Lomé Convention concerning ACP countries , agreements with Latin American countries and with ASEAN .
The experience we have gained will make it possible to improve overall assistance to development given by the Community and should lead to bigger scale funding through the main budget headings .
We have some Members of the House who are in these two committees and together with the rapporteur we could get together with the Commissioner to talk about policy in this field .
Not only do I accept but I welcome the proposal .
Indeed , on other occasions I have benefited from the expertise of some of Members of this Parliament regarding environmental questions in developing countries .
I must say that I have learned to appreciate and respect the expertise which this House has in those matters .
I very much welcome your proposal .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
GSP for agricultural and fishery products
To this end the machinery existing in the industrial scheme has been taken over as it was for application to the agricultural sector .
This is one of the occasions on which the cliché that the principles of economic liberalism are contrary to social solidarity is most effectively refuted .
In reality such a measure - the provision as a whole -benefits both the developing countries ' trade and the European consumer .
The view favouring the developing countries which has always guided our actions must however prevail .
In the opinion of the Committee on Development the search for formulae which will encourage development naturally carries weight .
That is also the feeling of the Committee on Fisheries .
What actually happens with the tuna loins and preserved tuna ?
But I do not want to use protectionist arguments , since the real problem is not that but rather that it is giving rise to fraud on an enormous scale .
To be specific , it is basically Mexican tuna fished together with dolphins , for which reason its importation into the United States is forbidden .
So it is a large-scale fraud which in no way benefits those countries .
So who are the winners and who are the losers ?
So who are the winners ?
They are third countries for which this system is not even intended but which use it as a front for a very well organized fraud .
I must therefore ask for support for this amendment .
Mr President , the rapporteur has clearly set out the reasons that led to this report .
I too can only deplore the fact that we are having to tackle this work within such tight time limits .
In one area , however , I must ask that we reexamine this business very carefully , and that is the area highlighted by Mrs Fraga Estévez .
I wonder whether it would really be such a huge encroachment on the European market to set these preferences at 20 000 tonnes .
That does seem to me to merit some examination .
My request , however , is that we approve this report , so that the scheme of preferences can finally be implemented in its entirety in this agricultural domain too .
Mr President , in principle , this generalized scheme of tariff preferences is an important political measure for the promotion of development in certain countries , especially the least developed countries .
We are dealing with it because the WTO agreement now has to be incorporated into the rules governing agricultural produce .
From an institutional point of view , what we are now doing has no greater value , metaphorically speaking , than a bluebottle stopping off on a dung heap .
What I mean is that we did not have any text at all to discuss in the Committee on Development Cooperation .
We as a Parliament are expected to discuss around midnight , without a quorum present , a matter in which this institution has no say .
I wonder why we are discussing such an important subject at all .
It is the second most important subject next to the aid that countries can be given by means of development policies , but it has been made to appear totally insignificant .
That is the position we shall take as a group !
In order not to prolong unduly the existence of an instrument which is characterised by outdated mechanisms , the Commission is recommending that the revised farming system come into effect on 1 July .
As far as the financial impact is concerned , the proposal is based on the principle of overall demand neutrality expressed in the losses of customs revenue over the previous system .
On the other hand , we plan for a very significative extension of the list of products covered - thereby responding to the request made by some developing countries .
Therefore , we are offsetting the preferential impact in favour of the countries most in need .
As far as South Africa is concerned , the proposed system gets rid of all exceptions which this country was entitled to for certain products .
In addition , with a concern to maintain Community support to efforts to fight the drugs trade undertaken by Andean and Central American countries , the proposed system extends special preferences and gives them a certain uniformity .
In this way the regime covering central African countries is extended to all products granted to the Andean countries for duty exemption .
In this way the policies of social and environmental progress will be fostered through an additional preferential margin wherever they are effectively carried out by developing countries .
Mr President , I paid very close attention to what Mrs Fraga Estévez said .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
( The sitting was closed at 10.50 p.m. )
Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Madam President , on the approval of yesterday 's Minutes ; in paragraph 3 , Mr Macartney referred to the flying of the European flag .
Very well , we will take note of your comments .
( Parliament approved the Minutes )
Postal services
The words of Cicero : ' How long will you abuse our patience ' , were often on my mind during those long days of waiting .
The report I bring to Parliament today on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism is of great interest to the people of the European Union .
Postal services are without doubt at the sharp end of contact with the people in their towns and villages .
It is a European issue that they can not only understand but can see in their day-to-day lives .
There are very few issues in this Parliament 's day-to-day work that can boast such recognition .
So this report is about not only the provision of postal services but also the provision of social services . In many parts of the European Union , it is impossible to separate the two .
For that reason in my report I have taken a different view to the Commission regarding liberalization .
I have quite openly and without apology taken the view that the protection of national postal administrations is essential if that social element is not to be lost to the ravages of liberalization or even privatization .
In its proposal the Commission accepts that there is a need for a reserved national monopoly sector that would enable national postal organizations to provide that universal service .
As far as I am aware , only Mr Wijsenbeek and the Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Group cannot agree with this particular principle .
Where there is a difference between myself and the Commission is the issue of which services should remain in the reserved sector .
I , supported by my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism , believe that both direct mail and cross-border mail should be maintained in the reserved area . My reasons for this are clear .
If the proposals put forward by the Commission are put into practice , the effect on our citizens , particularly those in rural and peripheral areas will be catastrophic .
These areas are not profitable when shown on a balance sheet and so will be the first to suffer under liberalization .
That is why I have always argued that the reserved sector must be large enough to sustain a universal service and must , of necessity , contain direct mail and cross-border mail .
This report is about people and those old , but nevertheless important , values like public service and people 's need . It is a report which protects postal services .
It is a report which ensures a service to the public , irrespective of where they live .
It is a report that recognizes the work done by thousands of postmen and postwomen for their communities .
Last , but not least , it is a report that puts public service before private profit .
In commending the report to Parliament , I would say to the Commission that if it doubts what I say is true it should ask the people of Europe .
For once in its collegiate life it should listen to what the citizens have to say .
They do not want their post liberalized and I am sure this Parliament will take exactly the same view .
Madam President , while thanking Brian Simpson for his report , I should like to extend my thanks to the Commission for the sensible draft directive on which it is based .
Added to this is the fact that we have fifteen Member States , each with its own postal service to which it has both allegiance and pride .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy produced an opinion which sought to strengthen and modify where necessary the Commission 's draft directive .
Our measures included the gradual and controlled opening-up of the market . It floated the possibility of a Eurostamp for the future .
We also sought to give consumers better protection from inadequate service . We also made proposals which fell in line with fair competition .
That initiative certainly was not a programme for retraining those unemployed or made redundant within the industry .
Madam President , Parliament 's Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights has carefully examined the draft Directive on the development of Community postal services and the improvement of quality of service .
Like Mr Simpson , and in the same spirit , we approve of the main thrust of this text , subject to a number of points which I will now set out .
Madam President , I come from a country which is proud of its tradition of public services in general , and of the postal service in particular .
We believe that the right of our fellow citizens to public services is a fundamental constitutional right which we must defend and promote .
We have seen in France over the last decade exactly what a remarkable capacity to adapt our major public services are able to display during times of rapid technological change .
This implies an open and dynamic view of the public service and of its global economic balance , and not a static and residual view of a public service reduced to the bare vestiges .
The injection of a dose of competition can serve as a useful incentive for modernization and competitiveness .
But this is not an aim in itself .
It must not have the result of upsetting balances within the public service , of weakening its dynamism and its prospects for the future .
In this connection , the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights would like to make the following points .
First , we believe the legal basis proposed by the Commission to be correct .
At one time the Committee on Transport and Tourism had proposed to add Article 77 of the Treaty as a basis .
We believe that this is a subsidiary provision which could not provide an autonomous legal basis and which would threaten to weaken Parliament 's prerogatives .
We are therefore against this proposal .
Secondly , the liberalization of direct mail poses a difficult legal problem , linked to the confidentiality of correspondence .
We believe that it is almost impossible to isolate this sector of the market , even if it were desirable in terms of maintaining the service 's necessary general economic balance .
I believe this matter needs to be looked at again very closely .
Mr Wijsenbeek knows who I am referring to !
Fifthly and finally , a draft communication , the notice , is also submitted for our consideration .
It is in the form of an instrument for security , stability and transparency .
This notice must be brought into line with the directive , as otherwise it will prove to be an instrument for insecurity , dissonance and obscurity .
Madam President , I welcome Mr Simpson 's report .
This House owes him a debt for the tremendous amount of work he has put into it despite much opposition .
If this study were to prove that liberalization will have a harmful impact on the social and economic development of , in particular , peripheral and outlying areas , then it should not go ahead .
Of course we all agree with the notion of competition .
That is something we must focus on : to get a greater synergy and a greater logic to the way we tackle these European-wide problems .
Finally , the implication for jobs which this liberalization could have .
President Santer and the Commission have signed up to his pact for employment .
This Commission proposal , as presently constituted and if Mr Simpson 's amendments are not accepted , could lead to a loss of between 500 , 000 to 750 , 000 jobs across Europe .
Madam President , before my election as an MEP I was a postal worker and an elected lay local official of the postal workers union , the Communication Workers Union , with which I am still strongly connected .
Postal services are performed by a necessary network of such people .
Each Member State should have a comprehensive universal postal service at an affordable uniform tariff .
In order for this universal service to be provided , it is necessary to reserve enough of the profitable postal services of the post office so that the post offices can also finance their unprofitable services .
That is why it is so important to keep in the reserved sector the integrated collection , sorting , distribution and final delivery of the mail as well as cross-border mail and direct mail .
The prime aim of the private sector companies , which are trying to get the EU to allow them to cream off the profitable parts of the postal service , is to make a good profit for their shareholders .
My constituents , who are all consumers , and the rest of the British people have rejected the Conservative Government 's plans to privatize the post office .
They do not want to see bit-by-bit privatization , as profitable postal services are hived off to the private sector under the guise of EU competition policy .
They want to see good , regulated , affordable , universal postal services which can be guaranteed with good quality-of-service regulations .
In conclusion , do not worship the new market gods of competition at all costs , liberalization and deregulation .
Public service is more important than private profit .
Defend our European public postal services .
Let me begin by raising four points which we in the Group of the European People 's Party regarded as central to our work on this proposal for a directive .
First , the efforts which some Member States have already made to liberalize their postal services must not be cancelled out by the European Union .
The postal services are fully or almost fully liberalized in Scandinavia while there are some other European countries that have not yet made any efforts as regards their postal services .
The margin for play must , however , lie with the Member States , we cannot prescribe what to do from Europe .
Secondly , we want as much competition as possible , as much monopoly as necessary .
I place great value on that too .
On the one hand we need competition to improve quality - you can speak later , Florus , will you please let me speak in peace now !
- and also in order to control prices .
On the other hand we need a long-term secure provision for the rural and peripheral areas of the European Union .
And that is why we also need a monopoly .
Thirdly , we note that the quality of cross-border postal traffic is pathetic .
I say that quite plainly : it is pathetic .
You are all familiar with the rule that holiday postcards to friends and relatives always arrive a week after your return from holiday .
We could never establish the situation as it unfortunately actually is through a directive .
We want uniform and good quality standards throughout Europe .
Fourthly , we want a fair distribution of charges for cross-border post , a very important point that has already been made .
Unfortunately the Commission did not grasp this nettle .
I think we will take a good decision on this question in Parliament today , which I hope the Council will also accept .
These principles I have sketched out are reflected in the amendments which the Group of the European People 's Party has tabled again .
Naturally we do not want that .
Amendment No 81 to Article 14 determines how the question of remailing and the payment of terminal dues for incoming mail from abroad should be regulated for the long term .
I would also like to point out that we should take the German version of this amendment as our basis , because the different language versions interpret it differently ; I consider that very important .
The advantage of that is that the universal service does not then have to make all its calculations available to the public .
We do not want to allow crosssubsidies but nor do we want measures that distort competition to be prescribed here .
I regard that as a good road to pursue .
Let me thank all Members , and particularly Mr Simpson , for their cooperative attitude and for enabling us to discuss the various points in a spirit of friendly cooperation .
Madam President , what we see today is a very good example of New Labour .
This is not Clause 4 economics , it is Santa Claus economics .
I should like to put one or two questions to the Commission .
Fortunately Mr Newman himself has made sure of a job in Parliament at the union 's expense .
Madam President , I should like to ask the Commission why there must still be a national level of post in an internal and open market .
Madam President , I should like to ask the Commission how it can be that a taxpayer has to keep on paying for abominable service .
Let us take Italy . 29 % of the post arrives according to the standards laid down .
That can only improve if we have open and free provision of services .
If we do not improve the post and we as a Parliament no longer champion the consumer , what have we been elected for ?
Why cannot we champion the consumer ?
We , as the Liberal Group , are the only ones willing to do so today .
The proposals of the Union of European consumers have not even been taken into account by the rapporteur .
It is too depressing for words .
I have got two minutes here .
I have raised one or two questions , but I shall just leave it at that , because only keeping quiet and crying serve any purpose here .
Madam President , first I should like to convey my sincere thanks and gratitude to Mr Simpson for a wonderful report based on common sense and pragmatism .
I hope those aspects of the report will be taken on board by the Commission .
There appears to be a total lack of understanding there of what postal services are all about .
I come from a country where we are very proud of our public services .
Indeed , our postal service is one of the best in Europe .
It is highly efficient , a daily service to all sectors of the community in all parts of the country at a reasonable price .
We have good postal services accompanied by a quality social service which is of immense value .
These two services go hand in hand and cannot be separated .
Therefore it is imperative that we protect our postal system .
I readily admit that there is always room for improvement .
Public customer demand will ensure that this is never forgotten and there is always constant pressure on our postal administrations to meet these public pressures .
I genuinely believe that the Commission proposals in this area would be disastrous if implemented .
We might benefit in the heavily populated urban areas , the normally profitable areas , but at a very great cost to the non-urban areas .
Quite obviously the profitable areas are needed to support the non-profitable areas , otherwise the postal system , as we know it , collapses .
Madam President , after having launched deregulation in telecommunications , energy and transport , the European Commission now wants to subject the postal services to the rules of competition .
The aim is to cream off the most profitable sectors for the benefit of large private companies , reducing the public service to a minimum level , as expressed by the notion of a ' universal service ' .
Once again the Commission has made no assessment of the social consequences of the directive .
And yet the direction taken is extremely serious .
It would result in the dismantling of the public monopoly , with the hiving off or privatization of the most profitable activities .
Users , and individuals and small businesses in particular , would then receive a poorer quality service .
The status of employees would be called into question and job losses would follow , as they did in the case of liberalization in Spain , Finland and Sweden .
Also , the Commission itself recognizes in its explanatory memorandum that ' the process of adaptation will lead to job cuts for the postal operators ' .
These operators employ one and a half million people .
No reformer or humanist can view communication as a simple commodity to be subjected exclusively to the laws of the marketplace .
It is a right which must be recognized by everybody .
It plays an essential role in social and economic cohesion .
In France , postal workers and trade unions were actively involved in the social movement at the end of 1995 in order to defend the public service .
Acting on our proposal , the Committee on Transport and Tourism is calling for the development of postal services to be coupled with an improvement in the living and working conditions of postal workers .
We refuse to subject postal services to the rule of money .
We are in favour of upward harmonization by developing cooperation between national operators .
We demand the maintenance and development of a quality public service , free of strictly financial dictates and respecting the status of employees and the equal treatment of all users .
Madam President , Mr Simpson 's report is right in trying to water down a little the Commission 's proposal for a directive on the postal services .
As far as I am concerned liberalization and throwing open the market for postal services must have a clear objective and liberalization must not be an end in itself , not an ideology or an article of faith .
If you look at the pre-conditions for liberalization , scarcely anything has been done at European level .
Mr Wijsenbeek perhaps lives round the corner from the Netherlands Government and the Queen .
Naturally the reorganization of postal services and operation of the market is motivated by increased efficiency and that naturally occurs also under the pressure of normal market forces .
Users are losing an important part of the service and employees are losing their jobs .
The Commission recognizes the universal nature of the postal service but it is trying to push its liberalization ideology through . Usually the two things by definition do not always go together .
That seems obvious to me . I think the rapporteur 's approach is reasonable .
Experience in the various Member States also shows that the postal services are important if not vital links in a policy of social and economic cohesion .
Madam President , the quality of the postal services in the European Union exhibits unacceptably wide variations .
A survey by Price Waterhouse confirmed that again not long ago .
That is against the consumer 's interest but above all , because of distortion of competition , it is harmful for businesses which are very dependent on the postal services .
The Commission 's green paper concludes in that respect that it is not desirable to maintain the status quo .
Meanwhile we are dealing here with a sector which often has a long-term and established position , not least from the point of view of employment .
Changes must therefore take place little by little .
That is the approach taken in the Commission proposal .
Another crucial point is how big the monopoly sector must be to be able to maintain a universal service which everyone can afford .
In this respect the Commission proposal with upper limits of 2 kg for letters and 10 kg for parcels does not go far enough .
Employment is undoubtedly an important point .
But let us not forget that traditional post is falling off and the postal services are increasingly facing competition from new technologies .
Controlled competition with incentives for innovation and modernization offers better protection for employment in these circumstances than maintaining the status quo .
Madam President , I fully approve of the report by my colleague Brian Simpson , whom I congratulate on the excellent job he has done .
The many amendments he has introduced render the announced liberalization more acceptable and amount to a significant change of policy .
As an integrated public company the post office also creates many stable jobs .
It is an institution which structures the national territory , contributes to social cohesion and provides services which are essential to a nation 's economic life .
And you want me to joyfully assist in dismantling this company ?
Certainly not !
The public service must be wide in scope if it is to be a financially viable proposition and thus continue to develop harmoniously throughout the national territory .
Madam President , Mr Fayot , I think we are living in two different worlds .
That this is the case is also shown by the marked economic success of the private courier services .
They are not successful because the postal service is so successful ; they are successful because the post is too slow , and that has to be said quite plainly !
Even the protection the postal services enjoy now should not mislead them into leaving everything as it stands .
Mr Ferber has already spoken of the five days it takes for post from Augsburg to reach Brussels .
But the postal sector has particular requirements due to its role in ensuring economic and social cohesion .
The postman is sometimes the only person whom elderly people or those living in isolated rural areas encounter on a regular basis .
This is why we must show pragmatism rather than an ultra-liberal doctrinaire approach .
The method chosen by the Commission of presenting a communication on the application of the rules of competition in the postal sector is in this respect a dangerous departure which should be firmly condemned .
I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Simpson , for his excellent work .
My group is in overall agreement with his proposals which seek to maintain a universal service of quality .
But I should like to make three points .
The universal service has a price .
It can therefore only be correctly assured if we maintain a reserved service .
We must look very carefully at the questions of direct mail and cross-border mail .
A new system of terminal dues is essential in this respect .
The directive 's review procedures are also unsatisfactory .
We must therefore provide for a review after a sufficient period .
Thirdly , we cannot liberalize without concerning ourselves with the social consequences .
We need an in-depth study into this aspect as quickly as possible in order to avoid brutal adjustments .
The Group Union for Europe is committed to preserving a universal postal service which guarantees equal access , adaptability and neutrality .
We therefore support this report and will continue to closely monitor developments .
I should also like to firmly contest the Commission 's approach as presented in its communication .
This communication can be contested legally and also in terms of its content which is contrary to the directive .
By voting for the Simpson report , with certain amendments , we will sending a very clear message to the Commission not to tinker with the universal public service of the postal sector .
The long-awaited Commission proposal has not led to rejoicing .
The balance is such that no-one was really satisfied : a compromise which for some went much too far and for others not nearly far enough .
What is now before us is a compromise upon a compromise and the question is whether we can really achieve anything with it .
Good and efficient post and telecommunication services are of primary importance for the European Union .
It should have been trans-European networks avant la lettre but it was not .
As things have gone liberalization of public services is meeting with more and more resistance .
The question is whether the backlash on the postal dossier will not in the long run have rather a negative effect on the provision of services and also on everyone working in the sector .
The European Union ought to be able to rely on outstandingly good postal services .
In many countries they leave much to be desired .
But in those countries an attempt should be made to move forward .
Since that is not happening or is happening only incompletely the question is who will pay the bill for that , on the social side too , in the long run .
I am not happy about it .
All that does not diminish my great appreciation of the way the rapporteur has done his work .
The speed with which he has worked might serve as an example to many postal services in the Member States .
Madam President , today we can coin a new slogan : New Labour , New Unemployment .
I enjoyed Mr Simpson 's speech enormously .
I regret however , that at no time did he give any consideration to the consumer or the user of the service .
Perhaps he could put my mind at rest that Socialists are not frightened of competition or the introduction of new technologies .
I welcome the Commission proposal and am against the Socialist position as it is perceived today , namely blatant protectionism .
I have some difficulty with the position in Holland and Sweden as they have gone furthest down the road to liberalization .
The UK position is that we welcome the Commission proposal with a limited introduction of competition and would like to consider new technologies .
I invite the rapporteur and members of the Socialist Group to be bold and to welcome a limited degree of competition .
I would like to see maintenance of the universal service which is especially important to the delivery of post in remote rural areas .
Also , there will continue to be a limited area in reserve .
I invite the rapporteur to put the interests of the consumer and the user of the service first .
I commend the proposal to the House and I beg its support for my Amendments Nos 73 and 74 .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , when discussing the future of the postal services today we are bound to find that the Commission 's proposals look very odd .
On the one hand it has presented a proposal for a directive , on the other hand we have the notice on competition rules in the postal sector .
The somewhat divergent provisions and intentions of the two documents have created disturbance and uncertainty among all the postal operators , employees and consumer representatives concerned .
That is why I am very pleased that Mr Brian Simpson , our rapporteur , has sorted this out with his clear and very realistic proposals .
Today the European Parliament must state very clearly that in such an important economic branch , the directive in the framework of co-decision has to be the sole yardstick .
The report brings out the main points : a universal service that really can ensure the basic provision of post for all consumers , even in outlying areas .
The reserved service , which really can support a universal service without the need for public aid to be granted .
Realistic time-tables for implementing the directive and procedures for amending the reserved services to make it clear what implications further moves towards liberalization will have for the employment situation .
We all know the stereotype answer of the liberalizers already .
Private postal services are efficient and public postal services can only operate with subsidies .
The approach the Commission should encourage in future is as follows : regulate competition and public provision in such a way that profits are not always privatized and losses socialized !
Hence deregulation becomes self-evident , otherwise the conditions are not equal .
The burden of proof in showing that the alternative is better should rest with those who claim that it should not be subject to equal conditions .
Experience where such deregulation has been implemented is good .
In Sweden , for example , a country with some very sparsely populated areas , deregulation works well .
The detractors often claim that many people lost their jobs when deregulation came into effect .
That is not the case .
On the contrary , new postal operators have taken on a large number of people .
The biggest private postal operator in Sweden will have a thousand employees by the end of the year .
It is true that post offices have been closed .
However , that has more to do with technical development and increases in efficiency than with the process of deregulation .
This technical development has presumably created many , many more jobs than it has taken away .
Mr President , I began by saying that different countries have different experience of the deregulation of postal services .
This leads on to my second point and my second conclusion , namely that those countries which have deregulated their postal services must not be forced to re-regulate them .
Mr President , as rapporteur , Brian Simpson 's task was not an easy one .
The rapporteur managed to bridge those differences and improve the original proposal for a directive , taking into account not only the economic consequences brought by liberalizing the postal market , but its social consequences as well .
A postal service must therefore be economically viable if it is to continue serving all such regions .
But when applying the rules of competition to the postal service , you must be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water .
I will not vote for any amendment which would result in any diminishing of the universal service currently provided in my own country where the post office is an efficient public company which is working well .
But a well-defined universal service must also ensure continuity of good quality service .
This amendment did not find favour with fellow Members but I hope it will attract the attention of Mr Bangemann and the Council .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the House has finally come to decide on the delicate matter of the liberalization of the postal sector .
I say finally , as this is a long-standing debate .
It was launched in 1989 and it has taken nearly seven years to obtain some kind of legal framework , which proves just what a difficult task this is .
Because we want to avoid any plan which would produce economic doubts and social failings .
This is why I should like to personally congratulate Mr Simpson who in this report has succeeded in striking the difficult balance between harmonizing measures and the gradual opening up of the market .
I believe it is essential for the public service tasks of the postal administrations to be preserved , and for this they must be left the means to accomplish their mission .
Our proposal regarding the content of the reserved sector covering direct mail and international mail meets this requirement .
However , I regret the Commission 's opposition but hope , Commissioner , that we will later arrive at a wiser point of view .
While we have great differences of opinion , that does not detract from the hard work the Commission has done on this report .
I want to put the record straight and record my thanks to them .
It is true , it took a long time for us to make our proposal .
The rapporteur quoted Cicero , which is appropriate for a Member of Parliament .
I am also grateful for the fact that the discussion looked at the main problems and that the time we have spent on this discussion has done quite a lot to clear up some misunderstandings .
Let me , however , deal right at the outset with some remarks that still echo these misunderstandings .
It is important to consider the alternatives .
If we do not have it , the services will develop very differently from Member State to Member State .
Situations of competition will arise that are not regulated .
Remailing has been mentioned .
It was described as piracy .
I think the fact that we are proposing this directive is an advantage in itself .
Of course it is no guarantee that all the results of the directive will prove acceptable , which is why we have to continue talking .
But I think for the time being we are following the right direction .
My second comment is about the Notice .
I have tried to explain this before .
A notice , and here I am addressing my good friend Mr Cot , is not a legal instrument in itself nor can it be .
Of course that will not happen .
But I would ask you not to underrate this Notice .
It is also a step towards cooperation with Parliament for , as you know , the necessary powers exist in the Treaty under Article 90 .
The Commission could make us of them but it does not want to proceed in this area without a discussion about using these powers , and that is the point of this Notice .
What are the main objectives ?
I do not believe we are in disagreement about our aims after this discussion .
We want the guarantee of a compulsory universal service that is offered to all citizens throughout the Community at acceptable prices and of good quality .
There is no contradiction !
This definition is established in the directive .
The definition of the universal service does not mean that we have also laid down the ways by which this universal service can be achieved .
If these aims can be achieved by way of competition , of a deregulated market , then why not ?
I have said on several occasions and will repeat again , in response also to what my friend Florus Wijsenbeek said : let us not enter into ideological disputes here !
After all , we have the practical experience .
The Commission and I personally have nothing at all against service publique .
And I quite certainly do not want to underestimate the role of postmen and post offices in rural areas .
I myself live in a small village with some 25 inhabitants , 10 cats and 5 dogs and we are all glad to see the postman .
That is not the problem .
The problem is how to ensure that this service continues to be provided for all citizens . That is the big question .
There are two options here .
That is not the problem at all .
We can have public law postal services if they manage to stand up to competition , which they actually do in some cases , and that is of course well and good .
After all we are not just talking theory here in a vacuum .
I think the Netherlands may be a bad example because it is an open country with a relatively balanced distribution of population and few remote islands and so forth .
But there is also the example of Sweden .
Now Sweden really is a country with a relatively unequal population spread .
The population is concentrated in Stockholm and Malmö and the regions round them while there are very empty areas in the north of Sweden .
Yet the universal service works .
Everyone everywhere receives the same high-quality service at the same price .
I think it is a good idea to take a look at practical examples of this kind .
The Commission has tried to do so .
We said that if we want to achieve this quality of service , then according to all the experience we have gained competition is still the best instrument .
Let me say quite plainly to those who want to ideologize this instrument of competition , for us it is not an end in itself .
We are not for competition in order to ensure that there is competition in any particular area , but we are for competition as an instrument for achieving this kind of service .
And that is why we proposed that this should be achieved gradually and very carefully .
We can discuss the dates of the review , that is fair enough .
Given that the directive is entering into force rather belatedly , one cannot start reviewing it a year later .
This needs discussion , but many of the amendments almost totally preclude this competition .
In doing so you would risk endangering the very existence of the universal service .
A few Members have indeed pointed that out during this debate .
But surely no-one can overlook the fact that at any rate we have a technical development which could even undermine a monopoly service !
Surly that is the real danger facing the delivery of mail , regardless of where you set the upper limit , regardless of how you define the reserved sector !
Those are options that already exist and they will become much cheaper .
That means we must now start trying to direct the postal service along the lines of making it more modern and incorporating other services in it .
That is one of the consequences .
But if we want to achieve that , we must not tackle these things too slowly .
That is why we are not satisfied with the amendments tabled by the rapporteur regarding the pace of liberalization and its nature and scale .
By defining harmonized criteria we also want to establish for the first time a guarantee of the financial efficiency of the providers of the reserved services too .
That has not been mentioned at all .
For the first time you have a legal basis for ensuring that a provider of universal services is also adequately remunerated for this , for the first time !
That means , this way of financing is the only guarantee , Mr Simpson , for maintaining these services .
That is why we must open this market up by means of gradual and controlled liberalization and , as Mr van der Waal rightly said , in careful stages .
This really is not an overhasty deregulation that would have particularly adverse effects on the labour market situation .
Let me say it again quite clearly , we have not brought up the question of privatization .
I think that would really be rather illogical .
If you want an effective public service too , a service publique , but do not consider it competitive in relation to private operators , then surely there must be something fishy !
You cannot be against competition if you have the interests of the consumer at heart .
That has been said here on several occasions .
In the end , after all , it is the consumer for whom this public service is created .
It was also underlined here that there is a long tradition of public service ; that is true , but what makes up that tradition ?
Is it having a small group of employees who have particular , secure working conditions , or is it to organize the service better for the consumer ?
I think the tradition of public service is the latter and not the former .
The French Revolution did not abolish the privileges of the nobility in order to create new privileges for post office workers , at least not in my view .
( Laughter ) I cannot give my position on all the amendments in detail .
In any case this is the first reading .
Let me present the Commission 's conclusions .
We want to create a balance between harmonization and liberalization .
The universal service is defined in such a way as to give central priority to consumer interests and the quality of the services , which is to be achieved by opening up the market more .
Liberalization has already become a reality in some large areas .
We need enough time , we proposed that , and the safety nets we proposed will always flank the measures .
Moreover , as I said , the financing is assured .
For the first time an unequal financial burden can be balanced , either by tying the licences to conditions or , as you know , by contributions to a compensation fund .
At each stage of the review procedure the liberalization measures can be evaluated .
We do not rise up in arms like Cato - let me translate this into dog Latin - and say : servitium postalis est delendum .
That is not our principle .
We want to help the postal service to become effective and efficient and thereby create a new image of public service .
( Applause )
So that information to this House was wrong .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11.30 am .
European Year Against Racism
Mr President , racism and xenophobia are unfortunately deeply embedded in European culture .
It is not just a modern phenomenon but something that has been alive for centuries and came to a tragic nadir in the Second World War .
It is a phenomenon which has marred or terminated millions of human lives in Europe .
We entered upon that venture and we made progress .
Even in respectable parties there are sometimes political leaders who play on feelings of xenophobia .
Those are things against which we must caution one another with extreme seriousness .
So we must not be naïve and name any names , thus providing them with extra publicity and notoriety .
We shall have to avoid that in this report .
So I call upon all my fellow-Members to take discerning view .
Do not name names .
But there is always something left over for European policy and we shall have to pursue that because we can see the phenomena of international thought pollution most clearly in this sphere .
We shall have to work to ensure that people who are legally moving in our Union countries can more easily acquire the nationality of the Member States and thus may be able to benefit from the Union .
That is an important point for the integration of minorities and the prevention of discrimination against them ; they must become full citizens .
Naturally there must also be in the media and with the advertisers , as is often the case , a clear awareness that their activity must not give any occasion for fomenting feelings of xenophobia in our society .
To be brief , as decentralized as possible , so that people can assume their responsibilities .
These institutions are not there to be brow-beaten by government institutions but they are intended as a facility for coordinating their activity which keeps the network together .
I should like to express an old wish , namely that minorities in Europe in particular should be respected as regards their religion , their religious views , because religion , we all know , is important for people .
For that we have LEONARDO and SOCRATES , in which facilities may be found .
I think that is an important signal , to the Islamic world amongst others , that we are in earnest about them .
Mr President , we are celebrating the European Union today .
With it we are celebrating also the incontrovertible answer to racism and xenophobia .
I hope that will also be expressed today in the voting .
Mr President , many thanks to the rapporteur for this excellent report .
I would like to point out that Parliament has not just waiting until the conclusions of the Cannes European Council to take an initiative on these terrible questions .
As early as the 1980s the European Parliament was convinced that this problem of racism must be combated .
During the last legislative term Mr Nordmann was the chairman of the committee of inquiry .
To turn now to the financial aspects .
ECU 5.4 m has been earmarked for this project in 1966 .
Fortunately this is now to be increased for 1997 .
I hope the Commission is aware that ECU 4.7 m are earmarked for 1997 , which is still a modest amount .
I believe that the nine-month preparation period is not just too long but also swallows up too much money .
Moreover , it is enough to have one representative per Member State on the committees .
It would be desirable to link up with item B3-300 in the field of information .
A link-up with other institutions such as the Council of Europe would produce considerably more efficiency in future .
Finally , a brief correction : the phrase programme de diffusion d ' images was mistranslated in the German text , namely by Bildmaterial .
I would like to adhere to the French version , even though Austria lost the football match against France yesterday !
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Oostlander 's report is most welcome .
Mr Oostlander rightly pointed this out in his report .
One means of combating racism and xenophobia is to show personal courage and not to shrink back !
Above all not to shrink back in the face of those who have made racism and xenophobia their programme .
You say that racism and xenophobia reached their peak during the second world war .
True !
One has to be allowed to say that if one is to combat racism and xenophobia !
( Applause , heckling ) The information this report provides about many phenomena and their causes , that information must lead us to do more than simply adopting this report today !
It is really a question of Realpolitik , which reflects but does not solve the problem .
And then the promise - ' never again Auschwitz ' - of which Mr Oostlander reminds us is not yet as widespread a common political heritage as it should be .
I have recalled these painful passages in the report because they are the very ones to make the proposal credible .
That is what concerns us .
It tries to make suggestions for possible actions to put the brake on this phenomenon .
That is why it is a good report .
But essential questions remain unanswered .
That says a lot about the fact that the schemes of the right and of the left are entirely left out .
We have less belief , we must say , in observatories which have frequently become in Europe only a means of squandering a little public money and of giving some friend a salary .
I think that one very important basic fact has been undervalued : the cultural fact .
In particular , I should like to support the proposal for a Council decision designating 1997 as European Year against Racism .
At a time when we are about to embark on enlargement negotiations , this would serve as a pertinent reminder .
This is why the Liberal Group supports it , confident in the hope that all the democratic groups in the House will adopt the same approach .
Mr President , racism develops against a background of unemployment and social and cultural exclusion .
It is fuelled by the discourse of hatred .
Racism is an offence and has nothing whatsoever to do with freedom of speech , and there are words which can be as lethal as any weapons .
To speak solely of France , Mohamed Azza was killed by a bullet in the forehead on 26 February 1995 .
That same week , Ibrahim Ali , a 17-year-old schoolboy from the Comoro Islands , was killed by a bullet in the back .
On 1 May 1995 , Brahim Bouaram was thrown into the Seine and drowned during a demonstration by the National Front .
On 4 May 1996 , in Sens , Mohamed Qouas was gunned down .
The list would already be too long if I mentioned only the racist crimes to which militants of the National Front have been linked - and this difference remains pertinent , Mr Cascalle .
Because to this tragic list we must also add all those who have died at the hands of anonymous attackers , encouraged by the racist propaganda of the far right , and also others .
Does a government which applies the Pasqua laws , which are not only founded on the tarnishing of the immigrant but also seek to reinforce such prejudices , ever stop to think of the responsibility it bears ?
Are we not arming these criminals in designating scapegoats for a social crisis which goes beyond any rational analysis ?
These crimes must not make us forget the day-to-day humiliations , the symbolic violence and the silent suffering .
To combat racism we must first strike at the root economic and social causes which nourish it .
We must also strengthen the legal instruments with which it can be repressed and conduct a global prevention campaign , in particular in the media and our schools .
The Commission 's proposal for a European Year against Racism responds to these objectives .
At last we have a proposal of the European Parliament which is being acted upon .
By better understanding others do we not better understand ourselves ?
In 1997 , we must ensure that initiatives are implemented in close cooperation with organizations active in combating racism so that the rejection of racism becomes a matter of concern to us all .
To fight against racism is to fight for democracy and to assume a fundamental mission .
I quote Mr Salman Rushdie who said : ' I prefer secularism to chapels , the half-caste to the technically pure , the cosmopolitan to the culturally correct and democracy to everything which threatens it ' .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I want to congratulate Arie Oostlander on his really very sensitive report .
I also want to convey to the Commission my great respect for its communication and thank it for the commitment it has shown in this matter .
Nothing has happened !
So racism does have a name and a face .
Names must be named , I agree with Martin Schulz , because behind them we find the spiritual fathers of the bomb and arson attacks .
I particularly thank Arie Oostlander for breaking a taboo and finally also stating the right to freely practice other religious faiths in a European Union that is increasingly projecting itself as a stronghold of the Christian West .
We must stop creating hierarchies , as will happen with Union citizenship if its excludes 10 to 14 million people from exercising their rights .
We need real protection against discrimination to be enshrined in the Treaty and we need to put an end to every form of institutional racism and institutional discrimination .
But then of course the right hand must do what the left hand wants in the Commission too .
Mr President , first I should like to congratulate Mr Oostlander on his balanced report which I hope the overwhelming majority of this House can vote for .
Second , I agree with my colleague Martin Schulz when he says that we know that racism and xenophobia have to be on the agenda of this Parliament .
A Year against Racism has been a long time coming .
Almost a decade later it has now arrived .
I thank Commissioner Flynn for actually bringing forward this proposal which we have been waiting for , as I said , for over ten years .
I am slightly disappointed with the level of resources available but that is something we may deal with when we come to the budget round .
It also means that the Commission has now clearly recognized that it has partial competence for dealing with racism and xenophobia .
I also want to say that I am in favour of the establishment of the observatory .
The abstention was from the United Kingdom not from the representative of the government of Italy of which his party was a member .
I hope he will reconsider .
The observatory has to deal primarily with the problems of racism and xenophobia in the EU .
The Commission proposal is a start but it is not enough .
In France the racists chant the mantra of ' three million immigrants , three million unemployed , three million immigrants too many ' .
The tune is the same around the rest of Europe even if the numbers are different .
We should remember the slogan of the Austrian Nazi Party in the 1930s : ' One million unemployed , one million Jews , one million Jews too many ' .
And we know what happened to the Jews .
Few know how to distance themselves from and create something constructive out of such situations .
The proposal for a centre to coordinate and initiate action against racism is thus an easy one to support .
A great and important task should be assigned to this centre .
With such courses arranged on a broad front , Europe would be better equipped for the work of giving our children and young people tolerant and humanistic ideals .
No teacher or youth leader in Europe who seeks an understanding of the anatomy of racism and hatred must be allowed to stand in need of such knowledge .
This would be a proud promise for the European Parliament to give on Europe Day .
Mr President , one proposal in the report is out of harmony with the others .
Legislation against racially motivated crimes is self-evident .
But we Liberals are strongly opposed to legislating against views and prejudices as such .
They are best combated by argument and by spiritual and material wellbeing .
We in the Liberal Group reject legislation against parties .
It would be a victory for the anti-democrats and a defeat for faith in the power of argument .
But the development and conclusion contributed by Mr Wiebenga 's amendment should further strengthen the proposal .
I will simply draw Parliament 's attention to the consequences of point 20 which attempts to legislate on the history of World War II .
In seeking to ban professor Forisson 's critical analyses of the written sources and lack of photos or drawings of the gas chambers , the Gayssot Act has added to their renown .
As free spirits say , if you need a law to impose a historical truth , then it ceases to be a historical truth and becomes a political truth .
And if you need a law to impose a scientific truth , then it ceases to be a scientific truth and becomes a religious dogma .
We believe that they deserve the same freedom as that which the European Parliament is demanding for Salman Rushdie or Taslima Nasreen .
, Member of the Commission . ( SV ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , racism is not a new phenomenon in Europe .
It is a problem that has marked much of our history .
Racism is deeply rooted and affects all parts of the Union .
It will require major efforts on the part of us all if we are to eradicate the scourge of racism , xenophobia and anti-Semitism .
The fight against racism and xenophobia involves the Commission as a whole .
We therefore welcome the excellent work done by Parliament 's rapporteur , Mr Oostlander , and the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs .
The European Parliament has long been calling for measures at Union level against racism .
Parliament has an important role to play , amongst other things in creating an awareness of the need for common action in this field .
The two resolutions that are being debated today have been drafted in response to a Communication from the Commission .
For the first time we have presented a Communication that deals precisely with racism , xenophobia and anti-Semitism .
It is a major step along the road to creating a role for the Commission in the fight against racism .
Our Communication forms part of the Union strategy against racism that the European Heads of State and Government called for at the Corfu Summit in June 1994 .
It is based on the work done by the Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia , which was given its remit at the Corfu meeting .
The Communication is also a response to the demands put forward by Parliament in many resolutions in this field .
I welcome the fact that Parliament in its motion for a resolution supports the aims we have set out in the Communication .
Our work has been guided by three objectives :
1.We want to fight racism in a number of different policy areas .
The Communication reviews all the initiatives that the Commission has taken or intends to take in order to combat racism .
The principle is that the fight against racism must be waged through a whole range of policy measures .
We have therefore proposed that the employment initiative be given a new dimension in the context of the European Social Fund .
The new initiative , ' Employment INTEGRA ' , is intended to make the labour market more accessible to such groups as immigrants and ethnic minorities .
Discrimination and racism make it particularly difficult for these groups to get work .
In our Communication we also emphasize the importance of giving everyone equal opportunities in working life .
In this context , I would make special mention of the joint declaration adopted by the social partners in Florence last October .
It considers ways of preventing racial discrimination and xenophobia and promoting equal treatment at work .
The Commission intends to support the aims of this declaration .
We also emphasize how important it is to combat prejudices and increase people 's awareness of the danger of racism and xenophobia .
We propose , amongst other things , a major effort on education ; the Community 's education programme , SOCRATES , could be put to use here .
The media people must also be given more support .
In addition , the Communication highlights the need to counteract racist propaganda targeted at young people .
Cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs must be improved as regards the detection and prosecution of racist offences .
2.We want to bring about European legislation against racism . We have two aims here .
One is an anti-discrimination directive and a possible amendment to the Treaty .
The Commission has already proposed that special powers to combat racial discrimination be written into the Treaty in the course of the Intergovernmental Conference , now under way .
We also want to secure Community legislation guaranteeing a minimum level of protection against discrimination throughout the Union .
We will return to this matter , when we know the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference .
The second aim concerns the need to ensure that Community law is applied on a non-discriminatory basis .
Pending an amendment of the Treaty , we will as far as possible include non-discrimination provisions in our proposals for legal acts.3.We want to designate 1997 European Year against Racism .
The proposal for a European Year is important , not least in order to increase understanding of the important role the Union can play in the fight against racism .
In short , that would help bring the Union closer to the citizens.The Commission welcomes Parliament 's strong support for the proposal .
It is now being discussed in the Council .
However , I hope that the proposal will be adopted during the current Italian presidency .
The Commission has carefully examined Parliament 's amendments to the proposal , and we will be urging the Council to adopt a number of these amendments .
To sum up , Mr President , I stress that the Commission is grateful for Parliament 's support for our Communication on racism , xenophobia and anti-Semitism .
You can be sure that the Commission will continue to do all it can to contribute to the fight against racism , and we think this is a very important debate with which to observe Europe Day .
Thank you , Commissioner .
Mr President , the Milan European Council decided that 9 May should be celebrated as Europe Day .
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen , 9 May is the political birthday of the European Union .
The date of 9 May is not just a holiday for Brussels and the European institutions .
It is Europe Day for all the citizens of our European Union , a Europe Day that belongs as much to the Scots as it does to all other Europeans .
The European Union is not impressed .
We are here today for an ordinary working meeting .
That is certainly what Robert Schuman , the first President of this Parliament , would have wished .
The European Union , Europe as a whole , is facing great challenges .
In this new Europe which we must shape , nothing will be as it was over the past five decades .
European unification began on the ruins of the great European disaster , which came to an end only five years before 1950 in an inferno of hatred and blood , death and destruction .
Today we are looking back on a period of economic development and an era of peace in Europe which has no parallel in recent history .
Against the background of the history of the European nations , the process of European unification over the last 46 years has been a unique success story .
It has been the most successful peace movement in European history .
And yet there is uncertainty and scepticism among the people .
They are not against Europe but very often they no longer know why they should be for it .
For Robert Schuman and many others 46 years ago , European unification was the only solution for securing peace and rebuilding the destroyed economy .
Today some people think Europe is part of the problem rather than part of its solution .
( Applause ) Unemployment , which is also a social crisis and can become a political crisis , can only be tackled through European cooperation .
Acting together gives us more chances , and we bear a common responsibility for protecting the environment and preserving the foundations of life in our Europe .
A realistic environmental policy and dreams of national sovereignty are mutually exclusive .
Either we manage to tackle the problems jointly or we remain alone and sovereign and they destroy us .
The challenges of our time cannot be tackled if we keep to the old methods .
The European Union that wants to introduce a common currency and to enlarge towards the south and the east needs to be more steadfast than before , but also more flexible .
That is the creative effort that must be made by the intergovernmental conference on the reform of the Maastricht Treaty .
And here we can be guided by the far-sighted realism , the courage to accept the new and the calm resolve of Robert Schuman .
We must not fail either , ladies and gentlemen !
( Applause )
Votes
Mr President , I should like to draw Parliament 's attention to the fact that the adoption of Amendment No 8 will cause Amendment No 48 to fall .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Mr President , the word bannissement in French comes out differently in some translations .
So we are against the word bannissement , which would represent a legal provision .
In addition we are against using names .
Let us first put it to the vote leaving out the word ' bannissement ' and the names .
Mr President , I should have liked to speak before you proceeded to the vote .
I believe that this vote is inadmissible because it is contrary to the general principles of the rights of the people of Europe .
I find such a position to be totalitarian , contrary to the Treaty and contrary to the general principles of European law .
It reveals the true nature of this report .
We have checked all that .
The text of this resolution is admissible and we have now voted .
Mr President , I should like to ask you to request the staff to compare the various language versions .
I assume that the original text of the report is the Dutch text .
In any case there is a clear linguistic difference between the various versions .
The French text speaks of bannissement . The Dutch text speaks of veroordeling .
The English text speaks of ostracizing .
Of course , Mr de Vries .
We will have the translated versions checked , as we have always done in such cases ; we will do so again here .
After the vote on the amendments :
Mr President , this has been a complicated matter and a very sensitive one as well .
I have written ' chaos ' in the margin against one set of votes because I did not understand what was happening .
You said the text would be aligned but I am not sure with what .
We will check that too , Mr Kellett-Bowman .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
A monopoly in itself does not give any guarantees of equal service to all citizens .
On the other hand , it makes for well designed legislation .
Besides , it is important not to mix up deregulation of the market for goods and services with deregulation of the labour market .
Deregulation of the market for goods and services may be good for the consumers , but at the same time it requires more protection for the employees .
Retention of monopolies on the postal market poses the risk of failure to cope with the consequences of deregulation on the telecommunications market .
If the postal monopoly is not able to meet this competition , jobs may be lost among the postal workforce .
The Commission 's proposal has met with opposition in a number of quarters , which is also noted in the report produced by Mr Simpson .
The debate has drawn in views from the major postal administrations in Europe and from the trade union movement .
Smaller state postal operators and private mail services have not contributed overmuch to the debate .
The discussion on competition as a means of promoting the development of this sector and bringing down prices to consumers has also remained in the background .
We think that liberalization would be good for existing postal businesses , since it would create incentives to them to improve their service and offer it at lower prices .
A multitude of new enterprises would also be created , which would provide jobs for many people .
These positive effects have been experienced in countries that have liberalized their postal markets .
In view of the above , we vote against the Simpson report .
It is regrettable that Parliament 's timetable prevents us from being out and about among the people on the occasion of this popular event .
I will not repeat the analysis I made this morning on the proposal for a directive on the postal services .
Over and above the present debate , it is high time we defined and laid down the notion of public service in the Treaty .
Through a more precise wording of Article 90 ( 2 ) ?
By adopting a charter of European public services ?
By setting out the rights of public service users in a statement of the fundamental rights of citizens ?
These various proposals have all been made .
They must now be referred to the Intergovernmental Conference so that it can clearly define the framework for action of the public services of the future .
I believe that such universality which becomes an obligation on the public provider of postal services requires a uniform tariff structure supported by a proper reserved sector .
Substantial changes are already taking place in the postal market .
The Union now has fifteen Member States whose postal services differ widely in their quality , performance and evolution in recent years .
New technologies are opening up new markets , alternatives to the traditional postal service , such as fax and E-mail .
Premium , high-speed , high-quality services have opened up new markets at premium prices .
Now even courts are opening up and legitimizing the possibility of cross-border remailing .
This climate requires an appropriate European framework to manage , rather than avoid , these developments .
I voted against the Simpson report today because it is based on a strong ideological streak of protectionism as the best way to preserve the public service ethic .
In today 's world this is misplaced .
The report 's balance is too producer-driven which , apart from the issue of universality , fails to take due account of legitimate consumer interests .
It strikes the wrong balance on how open or closed the system should be .
Philosophically the report seems to confuse liberalization with privatization and seems to regard any competition as being unfair competition .
To perpetuate Victorian attitudes and systems will carry neither the producers or consumers of postal services into the next millennium .
The Communications Workers Union of Ireland is seriously concerned about the implications of the Directive on the future of postal services in Ireland .
I would like to take the opportunity of placing on the record a number of these concerns which they have conveyed to me .
Firstly , I would like to question the use of the ' Notice ' procedure .
This will allow the Commission to decide unilaterally by 31 December 2000 whether direct mail should remain within the reserved area .
The Notice procedure , by only taking account of competition most relevant to Articles 90 and 86 , ignores regional and social issues .
It would have been more satisfactory if Article 100a had been chosen as the framework for the proposed directive .
Secondly , it would appear that the Commission has not taken into account the damage that will be done to the viability of the postal service in Ireland because of the proposals for liberalization of cross-border mail .
Thirdly , I dispute the Commission view that the different components of the postal business constitute separate markets .
Finally , international mail should remain part of the reserved service .
Ireland is particularly vulnerable to liberalization of this sector as 28 % of revenue comes from international mail - four times the European average .
After six years of consultation , today we have finally succeeded in approving at first reading this proposal for a directive which is of major importance for Europe 's public postal service operators .
I should therefore like to warmly congratulate our rapporteur , Brian Simpson , for his perseverance in undertaking such a thorough study .
This was necessary in order to maintain an efficient , high quality public service accessible to everybody wherever they live .
Today 's vote should be seen as an expression of the desire for financial and geographical fairness and social and economic cohesion .
A certain model of society was at stake , a model based on public intervention to guarantee public service missions .
In view of the great importance of postal services to consumers , we consider the Commission 's action proposals to be beneath contempt .
Nor is it something the public in the EU want or demand .
It is a result of the Union 's desire to force through harmonization and uniformity through legislation , instead of cooperation across frontiers .
On the other hand , we do not support the amendments under which the EU flag or the value in Euro should appear on stamps .
In view of the above , we vote in favour of the Simpson report , in that it represents an improvement on the Commission 's proposals .
I voted in favour of the report .
The post is a social service which should be available to everyone on equal terms at the same cost throughout the land .
The main task of the post office , and hence the mail industry , is to serve the public by moving mail at the lowest possible prices and to the best possible standard of service .
The main tasks of the post office should be regulated by law .
It is a matter for each individual country . There is no reason why the organization and forms of enterprise should be the same throughout the EU .
On the other hand , it is important that the national postal services in Europe and in the world as a whole coordinate their activities in order to provide the best service .
The postal business has been deregulated in Sweden .
It is important that Swedish postal services can compete on equal terms with their foreign competitors in Sweden and abroad .
All changes must therefore take place with due regard to the social and economic consequences .
Our group has expressed its firm opposition to the proposal for a directive by the Commission opening up the postal services to competition .
We welcome the fact that the European Parliament adopted these amendments which genuinely put the brake on the ultra-liberalization of the directive .
The Council must take this into account .
It is in this spirit that together with certain members of my group I shall not be voting against the proposal but abstaining .
Our final vote at second reading will be decided on the basis of what amendments the Council accepts or rejects .
Liberalization measures must indeed not mean the destruction of well-established services or that all citizens no longer have full equal access to postal services .
That is why it is essential to ensure equality of opportunity and the financial autonomy of small P & T operators too .
That does not mean that we should oppose opening up the postal service to competition to some extent .
A certain amount of competition can certainly be in the interests of the users .
Absolute competition , however , could mean that only the economically profitable postal services operate to the full while the universal service - to the detriment of many users - is neglected .
So it is imperative to choose the right road here !
In Luxembourg we can boast a high-quality public postal service .
That is why it is appropriate to consult the European social partners with regard to the ' postal services ' sector too .
I voted for the report , and I consider that the rapporteur 's amendments improve substantially on the Commission 's proposal .
I would , however , like to clarify some views .
The provision of postal services is a public service activity .
Experience in other industries shows that deregulation does not yield greater efficiency but more often , instead , results in increased unemployment and increased regional disparities .
In spite of passive , or at least not active , resistance on my part , this is the stage we have reached .
Brian Simpson is experiencing his finest hour .
The longest-running rapporteur-ship on a dossier ever seen by the European Parliament is drawing to a close .
The rapporteur deserves praise , even from me .
That is also more or less the only tribute I can pay him .
Because the present dossier is a blot on the escutcheon of all those who would like to call themselves with any justification representatives of the people .
The citizen has an incontestable right to post and to adequate provision of service .
It is better to forget as quickly as possible that the trade unions and the poor providers of services have succeeded in frustrating the internal market in this way .
Meanwhile it will be clear that my Group is not happy with the draft report now before us .
As the least bad alternative to our own amendments we shall support the Ferber amendments .
Oostlander report
Mr President , for various reasons the ELDR Group has voted for the resolution and the proposal .
It is necessary for the European Union to obtain clear authority to take action in this area of policy .
The establishment of an observatory for racism and xenophobia is desirable .
Finally , an anti-racism year is a good thing but it cannot stop there .
The fight must be ongoing .
It is also a pity that this half hour was then used by some Members to make the kind of statement we have just heard .
In my view those are two things we should not just let pass .
What is important about this report , however , is that we have managed to carry through some points which in my view are of quite considerable importance .
We must do our utmost to create greater tolerance in Europe .
Above all we must ensure that minorities have equal opportunities , not just so that they can integrate but also on the employment market .
We have now entered the reign of totalitarianism .
I refuse to allow this confusion and I voted against this resolution .
A simple reference to the texts just adopted by the House amply justifies my position .
Or alternatively : the European Parliament ' calls upon Member States to include ( immigrants ) in social and political decisions , and also to grant them voting rights ' .
And elsewhere we find Parliament denouncing ' statements of the Council in which , contrary to scientific facts , a link was established between unemployment in the Union and immigration ' .
Two lessons may be drawn from this anthology , which although not exhaustive is representative of the overall tone of this text .
The second lesson is that we must warn the sincere antiracists of the serious consequences which the confusion at the heart of the Oostlander report is likely to produce .
We vote for the report because we think it important to combat racism and xenophobia .
We would further point out that we do not think the EU should take over the powers the Council of Europe currently has in this field .
We do not believe that there is a ' European ideal ' or a ' European identity ' ; on the contrary , we believe in the diversity that creates the multicultural society .
Wherever unemployment is increasing , public services are deteriorating and social exclusion is being created , we also see racism and xenophobia increasing .
We thus also see the convergence policy currently being implemented in the EU creating precisely the negative conditions that are conducive to racism and xenophobia .
The authors of this report intend to pronounce 1997 ' European Year against Racism ' .
Such a decision cannot be enthusiastically supported by the Belgian National Front .
This motion for a resolution could in fact have very serious consequences for the stability and balance of our European institutions .
True democrats pride themselves upon an acceptance of dialogue with their political opponents , even if they do disagree on the immigration issue .
The ancient Greeks showed us the path of tolerance .
Is the European Parliament ready to disregard thousands of years of democratic tradition and Platonic rhetoric ?
I voted for the report .
It is important to combat racism and xenophobia in all situations .
Unemployment , a bad environment for children growing up , bad living conditions and social exclusion are often the breeding ground of racism .
If these problems are alleviated , racism will also be curbed .
Education , knowledge , diversity and human fellowship are important aids to curbing racism and xenophobia in Sweden , the EU and the world as a whole .
We welcome this decision .
We felt that we must point out that the point of departure for the European Parliament 's decision was a negative one , much more half-hearted than the Commission proposal .
My delegation and I have registered with great indignation the fact that a majority , although a small one , of the European Parliament has approved this report .
against racism and xenophobia ' ) .
The resolution does not just make what are virtually slanderous and libellous allegations , without a shred of evidence , it also cultivates a literary style ( ' ...
ostracize and isolate ' ...
) that harks back to precisely the totalitarian , fascist vocabulary that its supporters supposedly reject .
It is then only a small step from the early medieval punishment of ostracism to branding and from isolating to outlawing .
I read carefully and with interest the report on which we have just voted and I approve of its main thrust .
Some subjects need time for thought .
Respect for diversity has always been one of the founding values of the European Union and the European Parliament plays a major role in this respect .
Myself , I did not vote for two elements in the report .
To state that the European Union , due to the policy of its Council of Ministers , permitted ethnic cleansing on its borders is very regrettable .
I also find it inappropriate to cite the leaders of the two parties of the far right .
On the other hand , we must deplore the fact that our European Parliament includes some equally extremist representatives , and failing to cite these members lends them an unacceptable respectability .
The discussion of this umpteenth report on socalled racism and so-called xenophobia is one of the few times in this Parliament when one might wish that speaking-time were rather less restricted .
One would need at least half a day to sum up all the lies or follies of the report before us .
In reality this report , like the Commission communication on which it is partly based , has nothing to do with actually combating xenophobia or racism .
The report is intended once more at all costs to cram the so-called ' multicultural society ' down the throats of the citizens of the European nations although those citizens simply do not want it .
The passage on education and youth in the explanatory statement speaks volumes in that respect .
You could fancy yourself back in the time of the educational experiments of Nazi Germany or of the communist tyrannies , where education is used to shape the people 's political thinking according to the one true doctrine .
I voted for the report , but do not share all the views presented .
But to build up central organizations in accordance with the proposal is of doubtful value .
In most cases , this merely serves to produce more paper , without actually affecting public attitudes on the matter .
I think this question is best left to the Council of Europe .
I think it would be a mistake to set up internal border controls to restrict the free movement of third country citizens within the European Union .
Here you have continually ridden roughshod over the Rules .
Mr Cassidy has produced a very good report in many respects and presents some important points that are critical of the Commission in this matter .
We can agree with Mr Cassidy 's word of warning that unemployment is increasing , despite the fact that the common market is almost complete .
This means that our criticism of faith in the EU as a politico-economic market is correct and that it will not bring down unemployment but , on the contrary , will lead to more unemployment .
We vote for the report as a whole , but do not support all the conclusions drawn by Mr Cassidy , for example the belief that traditional growth will solve all problems .
In paragraph 19 , Mr Cassidy urges the conclusion of an employment pact that carries real weight but , unfortunately , he does not give substance to the phrase .
We learn nothing about what an employment pact would mean in concrete terms , so we cannot take a view on the proposal .
My Group would have been pleased to be able to vote for the Cassidy report if Amendment No 29 had not been approved .
An irresponsible decision .
My Group therefore had to decide to vote against .
In actual fact , monetary union would mean that Member States would lose the possibility of applying monetary policy altogether .
That concludes voting time .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 1.50 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 9 May 1996 .
Mr President , this morning a terrorist attack was carried out in Cordoba . It was the work of the ETA terrorist group and resulted in the death of an army sergeant , Miguel Ayllón .
Mr Marset Campos , the House has condemned this kind of terrorist attack on several occasions .
We do so again in this case and I will express condolences and sympathy to the families on behalf of us all .
Order of business
The next item is the order of business .
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 15 May 1996 pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed .
Sitting of 20-24 May in Strasbourg
Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure , one speaker may now speak in favour and one against .
Mr Pasty has asked for the floor .
I assume he is speaking in favour .
Why ?
Mr President , I understand very clearly what Mr Pasty is asking for .
With what is now proposed , we have no idea when that debate is going to start .
That seems to us entirely incongruous .
Do not take this amiss , Mr President .
Mr Pasty has put forward a proposal .
You have heard one speaker against it .
Of course we have to have enough time to debate other matters , but I was rather surprised by Mrs Green 's remarks .
We cannot have the House 's agenda determined by whether or not officials of Parliament choose to be here .
This House is sovereign .
That really is enough .
The Rules of Procedure are quite explicit .
I had not quite realised that Mr Pasty was speaking as the mover of the request but took him to be the speaker ' in favour ' .
And as the mover of the request he has the right to justify it .
Then Mrs Green spoke against .
Mr De Vries spoke in favour and I think that is sufficient .
We have to vote now .
Mr President , I just want clarification .
This is a crucially important debate for us .
So , if we could have that assurance , my Group will vote in favour .
I am assuming that the senior officials of Parliament know what plenary sittings are and that they will be present at plenary sittings for certain subjects . Surely that is only a matter of course in a working parliament !
( Parliament agreed to the request )
Mr President , I just wish to make the point that some of us are here at 9 o ' clock for the night sittings and know exactly who comes to these night sittings !
It is not the case that people are usually here when important discussions are going on .
The Secretary-General has indeed realised that , quite directly so to speak , for he is sitting beside me .
He will no doubt say the necessary to his colleagues .
Sitting of 5-6 June 1996 in Brussels
We have one more point , in relation to the sittings of 5 and 6 June in Brussels .
The Group of the European People 's Party has requested that the Council make a statement on the decision not to admit Croatia to the Council of Europe .
That would of course be entered on the agenda of Wednesday afternoon .
I call Mrs Oomen-Ruijten to move the request .
Mr President , we should very much like to have a statement from the Council on its decision in the Council of Europe , apparently reached jointly by all the fifteen .
Even though the Council of Europe 's Parliamentary Assembly gave its approval , fifteen of the members voted against and we would like to have a statement on that .
I would ask you to make time available for that , Mr President .
It should be possible to have this instead of the debate on the ombudsman .
Since nobody has asked to speak against , I assume the House agrees .
The order of business is thus established .
Return and export of cultural goods
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
The EEC Treaty set up an area without borders for the single market in which the free circulation of goods was guaranteed .
However , in turn , it became clear that it was necessary to make this free circulation of goods compatible with responsibility for cultural goods which are symbols of Europe 's rich and varied cultural idiosyncrasy .
To this end the EEC Treaty recognised that these states could impose prohibitions or restrictions on the import and export of cultural goods .
Cultural goods are those goods qualifying for protection and defined as those listed in an Appendix common to both the Regulation and the Directive offering an economic evaluation .
These categories of cultural goods include paintings - Category 3 - and drawings - Category 4 .
The financial threshold for paintings is 150 , 000 ECU and for drawings 15 , 000 ECU .
But this would have gone against the positions of the Member States whose definition was rejected and will also not have been a viable solution in financial terms .
We know in fact that as a whole , to generalise , the price of water colours is much lower than that for paintings and much higher than that for drawings .
Were the threshold the same as that for paintings a high proportion of water colours , pastels and gouache would circulate unrestricted .
In other words , the solution would be to create a category which comes between Category 3 for paintings and Category 4 for drawings , an intermediate new Category 3a to be inserted between Categories 3 and 4 .
Mr President , I think that Mr Escudero 's report has a certain value and I ask him to accept my congratulations .
However , Mr President , speaking for my group at least , I feel that I must draw attention to the fundamental underlying pretence of the directive and regulation that are being proposed .
Firstly , I do not believe that creativity is strengthened by emphasizing and protecting objects rather than their creators .
You will say that this has nothing to do with the texts that we are debating , but I just wish to make the point .
Many such creators of cultural objects , among those who are alive now at least , are quite emphatic about that .
Secondly , Mr President , I truly cannot fathom out this attempt - if my understanding of it is correct - to restrict international trade in cultural objects .
What is the meaning of it ?
In saying that such and such a cultural object must not be taken out of the country are we saying that cultural goods ought really to be available for broadly based public and social enjoyment ?
Then what does it matter then if a private citizen in the territory of a country which prohibits the export of cultural objects wishes to keep such an object at home purely for his own enjoyment ?
I fear that , essentially , the directive and regulation will do nothing but bring about a lowering of the value of objects kept at home by private collectors .
But why ?
Is it because we expect that as time goes by someone , the state that is , will be able to buy them and make them available for the pleasure of the general public ?
If that were the case there would be a meaning in it .
I do not think that cultural heritage problems which stem from the organization of the market and the circulation of capital can be solved like this .
Mr President , the rapporteur is quite right to point out that this is primarily a technical matter .
But he is equally right to point out that in the end we are concerned with the protection of cultural goods .
But we should also follow the proposal from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights and review the effectiveness of both the directive and the regulation after three years .
I think a separate comment has to be made on the wording with regard to the return of national cultural goods .
Who is the owner of the symphony from which we have taken our European anthem ?
I think the answer to that question is also relevant to the fine arts .
Mr President , I believe we can all be pleased with the two proposals submitted for our scrutiny today .
A remedy therefore had to be found for this practice , which I ' m afraid has been common in the past .
Remember the way the Nazis organized the pillage of works of art in the countries they occupied .
What is more , this practice has not completely disappeared .
Two additional bricks have been added to the edifice by this Regulation and Directive , as they introduce the concept of ' national treasures ' making it possible to give them protection under Community law .
Once again , we can only welcome these proposals and we hope to see them adopted like the report of Mr Escudero , whom I must congratulate for the work he has put in .
A comment and a regret , however .
If it is absolutely fundamental that cultural goods should be protected , it is all the more regrettable that the RAPHAEL programme has been blocked .
After all , this aims to protect Europe 's cultural heritage and it must be borne in mind that such protection assumes a minimum of rules and objectives that only a programme can provide .
So , ladies and gentlemen , the tree formed by these two measures is an undoubted improvement , but this should not make us lose sight of the wood of our shortcomings in protecting our heritage .
Speaking from that standpoint , I would like to urge the Commission just a little bit more to venture at some juncture to put its fingers on the stigmata .
Is the priceless cultural heritage , passed down from the depths of history , which has been stolen from countries such as mine for instance , going to be protected ?
Are those countries which are currently in possession of priceless archaeological treasures going to be made to return those cultural objects to the countries from which they were stolen ?
Even parts of the Parthenon , that immense creation of the human mind , are being kept far away from their rightful place , and their return is being refused !
In the impending substantial revision of the directive can we not insert a demand , at long last , for the return of such treasures to the countries they belong to ?
That is my question to the Commission , Mr President , and I would like a reply .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for once this report describes to us a legal mechanism that is perfectly in balance .
This is the mechanism of Articles 30 and 34 , laying down the principle of free trade , and of Article 36 , laying down the conditions for the protection of national heritages of cultural goods .
Why this Article 36 ?
In the end it exists , firstly , to prevent an attack on cultural diversity and , secondly , to avoid dispossessing the poorest of their cultural identity .
For with very little in the way of personal goods , they , more than other citizens , have only their national cultural heritage to enjoy .
Thus , the present cultural mechanism , which consists of a Regulation on the export of cultural goods and a Directive on the return of cultural goods , seems to us to be well balanced .
At this point , however , I should like to raise a question of principle .
Does free trade always bring maximum satisfaction to all the partners ?
Is it not a unilateral principle , originating therefore from a sort of hemiplegic thinking as absurd as its opposite : the autarkic thinking which would abolish all free trade ?
Does not the truth lie , as Aristotle saw , exactly in a happy medium , aiming at the common good ?
This is also true every time the production of a high quality product does not automatically generate a profit for the producers .
And then there is also the problem of access for the poorest .
Mr President , of course it is extremely important for those cultural goods that form or will one day form the artistic heritage of the Member States to remain in their original environment .
This fact alone suggests that it should be up to the national states to fix the financial threshold for certain categories of art works .
It should be left to the national states to decide what priorities they set and what financial thresholds they observe in order to counter the risk of an artistic sell-out .
The Member States are required to submit their annual reports by February but , so far , not all of the states have sent them into the Commission .
At any rate , the Commission undertakes to submit the triennial report within the requisite time-limit , that is to say during the course of the year , for more detailed consideration .
Thank you , Mrs Bonino .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Humanitarian aid
Finally , we think that making it necessary to discuss problems with humanitarian agencies and keep them informed can only benefit transparency and co-ordination , key words in the Commission proposal .
As I said , the final outcome is a good Regulation on humanitarian aid , which is why I am asking for a vote in favour of the Recommendation by the Committee on Development .
Let us hope , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , that we can be able to prevent conflicts so that humanitarian aid of this kind will no longer be necessary .
This work is a credit to the European Union , which , alone in the world , I repeat , is endowed with such determination and such instruments .
We should like these proposals to be extended to humanitarian mine-clearing operations and we are not happy with the results of the Vienna Conference in this respect .
In order to carry out all these actions , coordination with NGOs and international organizations had to be improved .
That is now done , and Parliament will receive an annual report on such aid .
We willingly accept that the Commission and ECHO can alone decide emergency measures not exceeding a budget of ECU 10 million .
On the other hand , we shall be much firmer and more watchful over the comitology procedure - I can not get used to this name - adopted by the Council .
The Procedure 3a suggested seems to us quite obviously cumbersome , expensive and sometimes difficult to implement .
I cannot say this too strongly : watch out for emergencies , watch out for delays , we would not be forgiven for them .
In Liberia , do you see States discussing whether a boat should be sent when people are drowning ?
Thank you for your efforts , Mrs Sauquillo .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first I too would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on behalf of our group .
We are concerned here with humanitarian aid , that is to say , the suffering of many millions of people in the world .
We all know that the money from this budget line cannot in itself reduce all the suffering in the world let alone eliminate it completely .
A final decision must be taken on this at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference , and on the abolition of the unanimity rule .
That is why the European Union must carry out a much wider-scale preventive environmental policy than before in order to prevent such disasters in future .
The UN 's basic expertise lies in crisis management rather than crisis prevention .
But the UN does not currently have the human and material resources it needs to put into effect a warning system that is both credible and independent .
Its excessively centralized administration does not lend itself to implementing rapid preventive measures .
Mr President , I will begin where the rapporteur , Mrs Sauquillo , left off , and I must compliment her on her work .
Indeed , humanitarian aid workers would not be necessary if it were possible to bring preventive action to a satisfactory conclusion .
The European Union is extremely active in providing humanitarian aid to crisis areas , and that can only be good .
Former Yugoslavia , Angola , the Great Lakes Region of Africa , we are there .
I am very proud of that and so are all the members of my Group and perhaps all Dutchmen too .
We are in favour of moves to give this policy a legal basis at last .
The Union needs flexible rules for decision-making in this area .
In my view the common position of the Council sticks too much to over-complex and time-consuming comitology procedures .
For this reason too the Liberals support the rapporteur 's amendments .
That penalizes the needy population , but it offends my own conscience too .
The objective is to get as much help as possible to the population and not to comply with a few rules .
The Union has constantly to continue optimizing its emergency aid , we know that .
The Union could improve its policy further by maintaining more emergency stocks than it currently maintains in crisis-prone areas , so that aid can reach the spot quickly .
Furthermore , as far as possible supplies should be purchased in the region or elsewhere in other developing countries .
This would provide a good boost , for example to local agriculture .
I have to say , the emptiness of the Chamber is out of all proportion to the importance of this debate .
Since 1992 we have had the European Union 's Humanitarian Aid Office - ECHO .
Mrs Sauquillo has submitted an important report that sets out specific objectives and general criteria for the Community 's humanitarian aid .
We were told that they have been or will be dealt with .
However , to date we have not seen a specific document defining the areas of competence .
Only on the basis of a common programme can we achieve anything in the field of humanitarian aid .
It was also said here that this is an area of foreign policy .
Finally , in my view we need a little more modesty and a little more cooperation with the NGOs .
The NGOs in particular have often criticized ECHO for taking a centralist approach .
Here we must encourage dialogue , here we are a critical partner ; then we will be able to provide humanitarian aid in real emergency situations .
Mr President , the Commissioner has heard from the rapporteur , the chairman of the committee and representatives of all the groups that he has compromised too far on the comitology issue .
The Council 's adherence to setting up new , delaying and secretive comitology committees prejudices this whole regulation .
Nevertheless , in supporting Amendment No 2 today this Parliament remains steadfast in its opposition to any extension of these excessive 3a committees .
The delay in translating those papers into eleven different languages can be measured in terms of extra deaths .
It seems to us that the Council is more interested in playing the politics of Europe than in assisting people in distress .
We ask the Commissioner to support Parliament in our resolve on this issue .
Mr President , I also would like to add my congratulations to Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco for an excellent report .
But , as Mr Howitt has said , this regulation represents yet again the wish of Member States to usurp the executive responsibilities of the Commission .
The comitology procedures which are proposed are restrictive and challenge the democratic role of this Parliament to which the Commission should be accountable .
The 3a committee procedure proposed is certainly not an example of either openness or democracy .
The proceedings take place in secret and the members are nominated by governments .
It is indeed regrettable that the nine most significant European Parliament amendments were not incorporated into the Council 's common position .
Parliament should not be fobbed off by the Commission 's willingness to submit an annual report .
The European Parliament is not associated in any way with the onceyearly discussion on general guidelines on operations .
The suggested procedures for ECHO are extraordinarily complicated and will deter the speedy and effective action that ECHO so often needs to take .
There will be elaborate procedures and delays .
ECHO is already under enormous strain - up to 15 , 000 contracts in 1995 alone .
It is inevitable that the policies , strategies and coordination of ECHO will be damaged by these proposals .
More paperwork will mean more bureaucratic delay and will certainly reduce the likelihood that our programmes will be properly prepared or properly targeted .
I hope that , following tomorrow 's vote , the ' development ' Council , which meets on 28 May , will be able finally to close this dossier .
The rapporteur has said how long and - let me assure you - extremely difficult the negotiations have been .
Basically , there are three points that I wish to make .
The Commission wishes at any rate to assure the House that we truly share that approach .
Turning to the three remaining amendments , I wish to make the following points .
I have also to say that , when it comes to emergency cases , the Commission is empowered to take its own decisions .
Thank you , Mrs Bonino .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Food-aid policy and management
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this report concerns the European Union 's food aid policy and creates a new legal basis for that policy .
What is the situation at present on the world market ?
There are more than 800 million chronically undernourished people .
The number of children who die every day is equal to the population of a medium-sized town in our Community .
This number will rise dramatically .
It will rise dramatically and new famines will occur , caused by factors we do not generally tackle .
What are the causes ?
They are natural disasters , whose origins we often do not question , such as whirlwinds .
Reference was made to climatic disasters in relation to the previous report .
That means that the policy pursued in this area ought to begin with the reorganization of industrial society .
We are seeing a growing number of wars .
I think we should stop these arms exports and the production of weapons .
It would be more sensible to safeguard jobs by reorganizing the arms sector and in any case we should ensure that arms exports are registered .
That is our point of departure .
We have devised a programme of food aid policy here that is sensible enough in itself but that cannot really take effect unless we also adapt the other policy areas .
I think that must be said from the outset if we really want to clarify the scale of the problem facing us .
This new regulation is useful , this new regulation sets targets and encourages self-sufficiency .
That is a step in the right direction for the countries concerned .
I think this dissociation from the EU agricultural market represents major progress and is most important .
Precedence is being given to extensive farming .
What we need is a reform of the UN World Food Programme .
It must go hand in hand with this programme which we are proposing as a legislative basis .
We were very concerned with the regional dimension , as we were to emphasize the role of women in production .
In many forms of society women play an important role in the field of agriculture , nutrition and food , and that needs to be supported through joint programmes .
As with the previous report , it is a pity that this Parliament does not have adequate powers .
I think that for the future formulation of this policy we need a co-decision procedure .
That is a matter for the Intergovernmental Conference .
The Council should get that into its head , but the citizens of our Member States and the members of our national parliaments should also take it in .
They must try to convince their governments , to ensure that we can achieve genuinely democratic structures here .
I think we will be faced with major famines again , and for the reasons I cited earlier .
One first indication is the price of wheat .
New markets are emerging , China is buying up wheat , the price of wheat has doubled and supplies have therefore become scarce .
This is a challenge to us right now .
We can only change this situation if we change the international structures .
We can only have a genuine food aid policy if , among others , we reorganize agricultural production in our European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , how could one fail to agree with Mr Telkämper ?
You know the old refrain : the Northern countries have for thirty years been living through a recurrent crisis of agricultural overproduction , but the world still has 800 million starving people .
How could one fail to agree with him ?
What is there to add to that ?
Mr Telkämper has mentioned some very specific points about these recommendations and I am of course in agreement with him .
I should like to single out a vital element of response .
This point can never be sufficiently stressed .
Europe has tried successfully to make the promotion of human rights the cornerstone of its development policy .
Finally , I should like , with your support , to make a serious proposal here for holding a major conference on water .
This is the essential element without which there will be no preventive or even curative policy on malnutrition and food problems .
Mr President , first of all I should like as usual to congratulate Mr Telkämper .
On development issues he is one of the safest pairs of hands as far as I can see .
I entirely agree with his analysis of the situation .
I had the opportunity of travelling to Angola with him quite recently .
I do not think we disagreed on any of the issues we saw there , so his analysis is my analysis and I fully support it .
The formulation of a long-term objective of food security must be strategically based , with specific targeting of aid .
This would involve a more regional approach to food aid , helping specific regions to build up their food-producing infrastructure .
Support must be given to the small farmers and food producers in the regions in question .
Macro-economic policy such as structural adjustment programmes should be brought into line with the requirements of guaranteeing long-term food security for all .
Securing guarantees of food supply will help to combat the corrosive poverty which exists in these countries and serve as a basis for long-term development and restructuring .
If we are to seriously pursue our long-term aim of food security then clearly we need resources to match our aspirations .
Let me say that the criticism that appears to be directed at Mr Telkämper is totally unjustified .
I support him entirely in his approach and I thank him for it .
We cannot let this decision pass by without raising the same objection that we expressed earlier .
These amendments provide welcome recognition that women play a vital role in producing food as well as providing it for their dependants .
Even before the crisis begins , women and other groups experience the different food entitlements which are common in many societies .
Social position affects how quickly women suffer from malnutrition and from starvation .
This is also true , of course , for other groups like the elderly , the disabled and children .
Reproductive health and family planning are also an integral part of our approach in this field .
They are crucial if food security is to become a reality .
Growing population in turn places an increasing burden on food supplies which , if crops fail , leads to crisis and starvation .
Malnutrition in pregnancy causes high mortality rates and , by increasing the chances of vitamin deficiency , leads to disabilities .
All of these factors must be taken into account if we are to realize a true policy for food aid and sustainability through the passing of this regulation .
It seems to me that this dossier tackles an issue of great importance and , as the rapporteur himself indicated , it is an area which has , of late , seen major changes .
First of all , I would stress that food aid is a fundamental factor in long-term food security policy .
We then move on to amendments which the Commission endorses , although it would prefer a different form of words ; these are in particular Amendments Nos 4 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 13 and 14 .
We now come most particularly to Amendment No 25 - which seems to me to be the crucial point - concerning triangular purchases .
Thank you , Mrs Bonino . The debate is closed .
Rehabilitation programmes for developing countries
Together , the European Union and the Member States constitute the prime source of official development aid , more than the United States and Japan put together .
Mr President , rehabilitation is now , or should be , in my opinion , a major link in the development process .
War , civil unrest or natural disasters are affecting an increasing number of developing countries .
The European Parliament , as well as the ACP-EU Joint Assembly strongly supported the idea of a special economic rehabilitation and social reconstruction programme .
That is the objective of the present proposal .
Basically , we need to create a framework of conditions to improve the production and services sector - the vital infrastructure - and the social , institutional and administrative conditions as quickly as possible .
The earlier we act , the sooner the population will be in a position to help themselves and , what is equally important , the conditions for medium and long-term development efforts enhanced .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commissioner has given us a most able account of her difficulties with the Council and I fully understand her .
We have the same problems , often even greater ones , and we just have to make the best of it .
But I note the great dedication of the few contributors - although the best - to this debate , which concerns most of the world and the poorest parts of it .
We are all convinced that it is the European Union which directs the greatest residual attention to emergency humanitarian aid , to rehabilitation and to sure supplies of food .
These figures are extraordinary .
Just now , we talked about the quantity of aid .
Well , let me tell you that we , the European Union , give ECU 500 000 per day to the Great Lakes region in Africa .
We obviously find money for the Great Lakes region : Goma , Burundi , Rwanda , but after the event ; we also find money for rehabilitation .
But for prevention there is never any money , never any attention , never any policy decisions .
At this very moment , Burundi is going downhill but we are doing nothing , and one day , when the pictures and the tragedies reach us , we shall give yet another ECU 500 000 .
When we were the European Community , one of the great policies was that of development .
Today , less attention and less money is devoted to this .
I am extremely concerned when I see that the European Development Fund is not included in the budget , and that less attention is given to such work .
We must not however forget , in spite of our difficulties , that we are still the wealthiest part of the world .
Mr President , it is a sad fact that whatever continent one looks at there seems to be civil war and genocide with its appalling consequences .
Half the world seems intent on destroying itself while the other half bears the costs of trying to bring about reconciliation and reconstruction .
The reality is that we spend billions of ecu each year just keeping people alive .
Help has to be given to rebuild not just their physical requirements but also their institutional organizations to give them the ability to run their countries .
The scale of the task is enormous and must be tackled step by step , namely food security , shelter , structural institutions and employment .
I must pay tribute to the NGOs on the ground without whose dedication very little would be accomplished .
The NGOs ' workers often live in appalling conditions in fear of their lives , and yet by their work in the medical and social fields they are responsible for saving millions of lives .
Any programme of reconstruction needs close cooperation between donor and recipient states .
If neighbouring countries can provide services or supplies this should be encouraged as it would bring further stability to the regions .
If a project cannot be sustained without continual funding it should only be supported if it has humanitarian benefits such as food security .
We trust and hope that action will be taken soon .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Bernard Kouchner is of course right to say that cooperation with developing countries has long since passed its peak .
That is the general trend : less money , less concern .
The upshot of that is that these countries seek to gain the best foothold they can in world markets .
That is the new solution .
And of course we are seeing the results of that . Last year Africa attracted 1.5 % of world investment .
When we talk here today about rehabilitation and reconstruction projects we are indeed talking of little more than ancillary measures , but they too are important , however bitter that may sound .
No one doubts how important they are .
We ought to stress , and Mrs Baldi 's report makes the point , that prompt action on reconstruction is of the utmost importance .
We believe these reconstruction measures should act as a real bridge between a past emergency situation and future sustainable development , which is the right way to go .
We regret the omission of a number of elements which Parliament had thought important , for example the need to increase national and local capacities by means of training .
The Council position also fails to take sufficient account of how to target specific groups , but nevertheless we think that the position is deserving of our support , and Mrs Baldi 's report certainly is too .
Mr President , I wish first of all to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work .
I should nevertheless like to stress two points which could , I believe , hinder the progress of this programme .
The first relates to the cumbersome nature of the structures set up to assist the Commission .
In my view , this problem also goes well beyond the single case of the text submitted to us .
The second point concerns the implementation of these programmes .
The European Union should take the greatest care to monitor everyone involved in implementation .
NGOs , enterprises and associations should , above all , be chosen from within the developing countries concerned and within countries of the European Union .
Too often , unfortunately , we find that community funds are being used by organizations which are in reality only facades for large American firms .
Commissioner , on this regulation , in introducing new comitology we remain furthest apart .
Council in this instance requires a 3a committee for all actions above ECU 2m , whereas you join with us in seeking a 1a advisory committee for all actions .
I have to put to you : do you have the courage to act on your convictions and on this Parliament 's beliefs ?
I would ask you to respond specifically to that point in reply to our debate .
I am concerned that the common position says it has accepted Amendment No 5 , but that once again disabled people have dropped out of the text .
Disability is currently an invisible issue in too many of our development programmes and making disabled people visible will require positive action , risk and experiment .
Other disabilities arise out of malnutrition , for example blindness , and vitamin deficiency .
Some disabled people 's lives can be transformed through specialist rehabilitation ; through exercise , mobility aids , prosthetics , and so on .
Disabled people can then be enabled to become contributors to their communities rather than being forced into dependence .
We ask you to look again at the wording of Amendment No 5 and we ask you to reply on the issue of comitology .
Mr President , in the course of this decade we have seen a shift in the emphasis as far as global development priorities are concerned .
Increasingly , we have funded military action as tension and conflict get out of control .
In the absence of timely political action , humanitarian aid then steps in to pick up the pieces .
But long-term investment in properly targeted development assistance seems not to enjoy that same priority .
We do not seem to be putting in first place the importance of targeting proper poverty-alleviation programmes .
I know that the Commissioner would agree that humanitarian aid should not at any time be seen as a substitute for political action .
Of course I support the principle behind the initiative we are discussing this evening .
Financing operations to progressively take over from humanitarian action and paving the way for long-term development planning is very welcome .
The regulation shows , in fact , that the Commission recognizes that there is a necessity for better coordination between available instruments and that the elaboration of a more holistic approach to development is also very welcome .
However , as Mr Howitt has said , we have to criticize the arrangements Council is proposing for the implementation .
For grants of more than ECU 2m a type 3a committee is to be used .
The Council should not be mistaken .
Standardization is by no means synonymous with simplification .
Many of us will remember all too well the failure of the special initiative for African recovery .
It is quite clear that comitology played its part in what turned out to be a totally ineffective operation .
I shall not therefore spend time on those which we are accepting , given that , clearly , it seems to me to be of greater interest to seek to discuss those which raise a series of problems .
The Commission clearly understands the pressure being exerted by the House , but it seems to us that , in the existing framework of interinstitutional relations as currently codified , the Commission cannot accept those amendments .
I wish to thank the Commissioner , but there is one point that I should like us to look at again together .
That is why we wish to retain a particular interest in that region - because it is genuinely of great importance to us .
The Commission agrees with you , Mrs Baldi , about the very special importance of that region .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 24 May 1996 .
Mr President , I should like to refer to the Rules of Procedure , more particularly Rule 5 .
No check is made as to whether Members actually travel to and from their country or whether they pocket money by travelling cheaply .
Our fellow-Members Mrs Aelvoet and Mr Lannoye have also made statements to the same effect , which have received extensive coverage in the Belgian press .
Rule 5 of the Rules of Procedure provides that the Bureau is to lay down rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members .
Rule 4 of the Bureau 's rules provides amongst other things , first that Members are entitled to the lump sum travel allowance mentioned in Article 1 ( 1 ) for only one return journey each week .
Secondly , if a Member makes more than one return journey in a working week he receives for the extra journeys an allowance for the travelling expenses actually incurred .
Car journeys are reimbursed on the basis of the first class rail fare .
I am of course informed of remarks and public statements by our colleagues on the practice of Members with regard to the payment of expenses and allowances .
I can tell you here and now that Rules 4 and 5 of the Rules of Procedure will be applied , and applied to the letter .
The Bureau is prepared to examine proposals for further tightening of the controls .
I believe that sweeping allegations , which bring not only individual Members but our whole Parliament into public disrepute , are most unhelpful .
On a personal matter Mr President .
My name has been mentioned here and I wish to make a reply .
I will read you Article 6 of the Treaty .
It says : ' Within the scope of application of this Treaty , and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein , any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited ' .
Mr President , am I regarded as doing different work from my neighbour , Mr Giansily ?
Am I regarded as doing different work from my 625 other fellow-Members here ?
But you are not bold enough for that .
You will have to apply Article 6 of the Treaty .
Mr Wijsenbeek , allow me to advise you and all other Members that the Bureau took the decision I have outlined on the basis of the political responsibility it bears .
Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Mr President , my name has not been included in the attendance register in the Minutes , but I was present .
You can check that by looking at the results of the roll .
I ask that the register be amended accordingly .
We shall correct that , Mr Malangré .
( Parliament approved the Minutes )
Mr President , I ask to speak under Rule 108 of our Rules of Procedure , which states very clearly that Members have the right to ask to make a personal statement .
That is normally allowed once the item under discussion on the agenda has been dealt with .
The item under discussion on the agenda was the speech by Mr Martens , who referred to a Belga report but also mentioned statements .
I have the right under Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure speak in order to refute any remarks made about my person .
The statement I made and Paul Lannoye 's too were correct as regards the system applying today .
We have simply proposed another system .
I do not think it is right for Mr Martens to associate our names with statements by the Belga press agency , which were partially incorrect .
Welcome
We bid you and your delegation a warm welcome .
Urgent political matters
The next item is the statement by the Commission on urgent political matters of major importance .
Before calling Mr Santer , I should like to remind you of the rules . The rules are that after the Commission statement questions may be asked .
Each questioner is allowed one minute , and in view of the large number of questions to be asked I shall ensure that this one minute is not exceeded .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am here today to talk to you about a subject of the utmost importance to our Union - the campaign against unemployment .
The reason was that the Council was unable to achieve either the qualified majority needed to approve the decision or the simple majority needed to reject it .
This is what the Commission did this morning , adhering to the consistent line it has followed since the start of this crisis .
It follows that the Commission cannot take a formal decision until immediately after that , in other words on 10 June .
As for the implementation of the decision , I would remind you that a number of very strict conditions have to be satisfied in order to ensure the protection of health .
Those conditions relate to the methods of production , monitoring and control , and the identification of undertakings authorized to export .
As soon as the British authorities have made the necessary arrangements and the Commission has been able to verify that those arrangements are effective , the partial raising of the embargo will become a fact .
The Commission , then , has complied with its responsibilities .
It will continue to do so , with the aim of arriving as soon as possible at normalization of trade with the United Kingdom in the beef and veal sector .
That is the message I delivered yesterday when I met with the British Foreign Secretary and Minister of Agriculture , Mr Rifkind and Mr Hogg .
But , talking about normalization , we cannot ignore the extremely serious situation that currently exists at the Council because of the blatant and deliberate policy of obstruction being pursued by the United Kingdom .
The Commission debated this matter in depth this morning .
It expresses its grave concern regarding the obstacles thus created to the proper functioning of our institutions .
Such attitudes have no place in a Union based on law and solidarity - which , by definition , is reciprocal .
Such attitudes are contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the Treaty .
With your permission , ladies and gentlemen , I shall quote from Article 5 of the Treaty , which reads as follows :
They shall facilitate the achievement of the Community 's tasks .
But Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would not want to anticipate the in-depth debate on this matter that you will be holding tomorrow .
The Commission , in the person of Commissioner Fischler , will be participating in that debate and will give you any additional information you may require .
What is our approach ?
First , the Union really must make employment a matter of common interest .
Let us take this fact as a starting point : the strategy set out in the White Paper on Growth , Competitiveness and Employment in 1993 is a good strategy , but its implementation needs to be improved .
It has to move into a higher gear .
Growth is essential in order to create jobs . But that does not mean growth at any price .
It must be sustainable and based on monetary stability and a sound financial policy . In this sense , the single currency is the ally of future generations .
Efforts at budgetary consolidation must be stepped up , and stepped up in a manner favourable to employment . Those efforts , of course , are a matter for national jurisdiction .
But it is necessary for the Member States to update their programmes and to do more to emphasize consistency between the various national measures in favour of convergence and the promotion of employment .
It is also necessary for that consistency to be evaluated at Union level , and for the Council to be able to issue more specific recommendations within the context of the broad guidelines of economic policy .
The lines of action I have listed are also designed to strengthen our competitiveness .
We have another trump card as far as competitiveness is concerned - our internal market .
We must fully exploit its potential - all its potential .
For the sake of clarity , a number of things need to be done before the end of 1996 .
These measures need to be adopted before the end of 1996 . But adopting directives will not be enough .
Those directives also need to be transposed into national law , and applied as such .
We have launched an initiative designed to simplify the legislation . We are going to extent it .
How many times have the Heads of State and Government sung the praises of the transEuropean networks ?
What I want is to see these fine words converted into action and , once and for all , a decision taken on the proposals for supplementary financing made by the Commission .
As I have said , we need to do more to help our enterprises , and especially the small- and medium-sized enterprises .
The adoption of the new action programme for small- and medium-sized enterprises before the end of this year would show that our governments are seriously pursuing that objective .
Furthermore , the level of state aid is amounting to several tens of thousands of millions of ecus per year within the Union .
We need to reconsider how this aid can best contribute to the creation of lasting jobs , while still safeguarding fair competition .
To strengthen our competitiveness is vital . And we also need to ensure that our competitive enterprises have fair access to the export markets .
Those , ladies and gentlemen , are our areas of action for the months immediately ahead .
I have given you , then , a broad outline of the action to be taken for the benefit of employment in the macroeconomic framework and the context of the internal market .
In order to active the national employment policies , we recommend that the administrative systems for employment should be reformed , for example by simplifying aid to recruitment or to the creation of microenterprises .
We recommend that the local actors should be mobilized , for example by the decentralization of employment systems and the promotion of local development and employment initiatives .
Finally , we recommend the development of common guidelines on the future of social protection by way of the harmonization of direct taxation and of the replacement revenues .
As regards the major projects for the future , the Pact explores new approaches to the organization of labour and of education / training as levers to create access to employment .
The consequences for labour of the information society : this needs to be dealt with .
The Commission will be drawing up the new Objective 2 programmes on this basis .
Early in 1997 , the Commission will decide upon the revision of the programme , taking account of that impact .
In applying the Structural Funds we must choose priorities that benefit employment .
Thus , we want to give precedence to innovative action in favour of small- and medium-sized enterprises and a closer partnership between the Structural Funds and the European Investment Bank .
It is also necessary to emphasize the anticipation of industrial change and changes in employment by making it a priority to support the most seriously affected sections of society , and innovative schemes .
The full efficiency of the reforms of the employment system , like the efficiency of innovative steps by businesses , depends on the mobilization of the public and private actors on the appropriate territorial scale .
We do not want to create new structures .
You now know the rules , of course .
Questions will be taken on the basis of requests to speak that are made in the course of Question Time and not on the basis of a list of speakers .
I now open Question Time with the President of the Commission .
I hope you fare well in Rome at the forthcoming tripartite conference .
We feel there is a little complacency and a lack of balance .
Finally , you mentioned the Essen follow-up process .
One of the important elements coming out of Madrid was the idea of common uniform employment indicators .
Could you tell us please what progress you are making vis-à-vis Member States .
That is a very important democratizing element to the Essen follow-up process .
On the other hand , of course , it is necessary for the actions we are proposing today to be translated into specific agreements , especially as regards the employability of the young .
It is necessary , then , for very specific commitments to be entered into by all those concerned , not only at government level but also at the level of the social partners .
Furthermore , we are conducting a dialogue with the social partners on a number of these matters .
Progress has been achieved in this respect , but to make that kind of progress on all the points arising out of Essen is not enough .
It is statistical progress , but it needs to be given more substance if we are to make real progress along the road to the reduction of unemployment .
Mr President , I should like to ask Commission President Santer what message your communication sends to young unemployed people .
I am quite well aware that employment can be created artificially but new jobs cannot be talked into existence .
I should therefore like to see more measures to ensure the necessary structural changes , more deregulation , liberalisation and the abolition of old national monopolies in Europe .
We are also going to submit to the social partners the entire complex of problems associated with the integration of the young .
And we are asking for the development of mechanisms based - as I have said just now - on the Youth Start and Leonardo programmes .
This is an initiative to be developed jointly with the Commission and Member States .
President Santer , I hope your perseverance will obtain concrete results at the Florence summit .
And with regard to the training and education policy I have not heard anything about a proposal - which was in the white paper - about lifelong learning .
Do you not think that the Commission should tackle that subject of employment and the training for our human capital , which is so important for the future ?
Mr President , Mr Barón Crespo is right to stress this point .
It does indeed appear in our communication , and in the White Paper which was presented by Mrs Cresson .
We must indeed place a very special emphasis on education and continuing vocational training , or the lifelong learning process .
In this context , you will find that our communication has something to say about education and training as levers to open access to employment .
I entirely agree with you that these elements are becoming a key factor in the framework of these activities designed to reduce unemployment , especially among the young .
In doing that I hope we will not give the national governments an opportunity to create the impression that the responsibility for high rates of unemployment lies with Europe .
Would the President agree with me that perhaps the additionality clause in the regulations needs to be looked at ?
On the one hand we are saying to governments that they must reduce their deficits and taxation , on the other they must increase spending in order to match European money .
Does he think that this policy needs to be reviewed and that an individual regulation to suit each Member State is required in the spending of structural funds ?
I believe that these funds still offer a great many opportunities , because three-quarters of them are used in regions where two-thirds of our unemployment is concentrated .
In that same context , you also refer to taxation .
This , then , is an overall programme , and when it is studied is important not to take individual points out of context .
You are right to lay particular stress on the importance of the structural funds which , perhaps , are not being sufficiently used to reduce unemployment in the regions in question .
First of all , President Santer , bravo .
You can attend the forthcoming summit meetings confident in the strong support of this Parliament .
However , I cannot refrain from expressing my major fear .
All these measures are small-scale ones .
Flexibilization , tax improvements , better training - all these things are necessary .
The ideas are right .
This is an important debate which concerns all our Member States , and not one in which the Commission can impose a decision .
In other words , this is a whole group of problems which covers what you have called working hours .
We need to be innovative in this area , and I hope this is one of the major lines of thought which our social partners will be pursuing .
Mr President , as far as employment is concerned , it is of course possible to establish certain links between BSE and the culling of livestock .
A number of social problems have also been created , especially in rural areas and in the agricultural sector .
I am certainly not unaware of the scale of this problem as regards the matter with which we are currently concerned .
On the other hand , I must tell you that the matters proposed to us yesterday by the British delegation will the subject of further discussions .
What is at issue is a step-by-step approach to the ultimate lifting of the embargo .
So a framework has been established .
I believe this is the right approach , and indeed it is the approach which we have been constantly recommending since the crisis began , ever since 20 or 21 March .
The first essential is to restore consumer confidence so as to bring market stability via specific activities designed to eradicate BSE - mad cow disease - completely .
The British delegation has made a number of proposals to us .
Commissioner Fischler will be presenting them to you tomorrow . He is the expert in these matters , not me .
My only regret , and I say this frankly before your Parliament , is that we have wasted at least six to eight weeks before reaching any specific solutions .
That is my regret , and that is why I share your apprehension .
Mr President , two short questions .
Yesterday the Council of Ministers , without the United Kingdom , adopted the directive on parental leave .
The Commission is very alert to competition problems .
Does it not feel that the absence of the child-minding directive in a single country might distort competition between the states ?
My second question is this : our states are caught between two fires .
One is compliance with the convergence criteria , and the other is the reduction of tax capabilities .
As you are well aware , the Commission - in common with Parliament - requested that the social chapter should be integrated into the Treaty at the intergovernmental conference .
I believe this is the right thing to do , and we shall support it fully ; I hope that an agreement on this matter will be reached at the intergovernmental conference .
This approach ensures that joint consideration will have been given to the balance between the taxes on earned and unearned income .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Santer on putting such a high priority on unemployment .
But I am rather afraid that the confidence pact will seem to be an idol with feet of clay , because I still do not see any real pact .
I should like to ask Mr Santer how he thinks of bringing about a really serious pact .
Besides , my view is that the Commission must set the example .
The LEONARDO programme has been a failure on a number of occasions as an example where cooperation is possible between social partners and the business world .
But I am amazed to find that in the preliminary draft budget that programme , which has been redrafted several times , is never increased but has its resources cut .
I think we cannot be serious if we approach a pact in this way .
This commitment to negotiations between the social partners could initially be reached on four matters , which seem to me essential , as of now . Negotiations must begin .
We have the result of initial negotiations on parental leave .
We have need to go further .
One line of approach , it seems to me , relates to part-time working , which is atypical , and would in itself represent a significant support for the concept of the pact .
Secondly , the social partners are going to try to produce a joint manifesto - that is what they have agreed to do - on the integration of young people in the employment market .
Thirdly , they are going to produce a framework text on training , which is equally essential as a lever for providing access to employment .
And fourthly , they are going to produce a joint opinion on the structural funds .
All this in itself seems to me to represent a very decisive commitment by the social partners at that level .
I should like to ask how you assess the value of the single energy market in terms of new job opportunities .
Is energy , as a cost factor of location in Europe , not perhaps being overpriced here ?
Have we not been grossly underestimating the importance of environmental protection as a means of securing and creating jobs ?
Mr President , I can say that I am in agreement with what the honourable Member has said where it is not in conflict with what I have just said .
What we want to do with the internal market is to take full advantage of all its potential .
That market has been created by a number of directives , but it is not yet functioning as an internal market , since some sectors are still protected .
We have decided to liberalize telecommunications .
We have now made proposals to the effect that the electricity market should also be liberalized , but that is not the same as saying that we are opposed to alternative energy sources .
Quite the reverse .
We have not yet reached that point .
That is why European business is still unable to exploit all the potential inherent in this internal market .
Not taking any risks is the greatest risk , President Santer , as you so rightly said .
So it is not a matter of merely producing piecemeal measures but of ensuring that we create a common framework .
We do not want any new structural-fund resources but rather more effective application of the existing structural funds .
Is it not equally necessary to tell them that we must devote more of our resources to practical education and to the promotion of vocational training ?
But in our view this also means that we must not reduce still further the already meagre Leonardo funds .
We must therefore make it clear to these countries that it is not a matter of pursuing new whimsical policies but quite simply of distributing more prudently the funds that are available .
Mr President , I am in agreement with the honourable Member , because - as I have been at pains to make clear - we are not intending to reinvent the wheel .
We want to build on the substance of the 1993 White Paper on Competitiveness , Employment and Competition , but we are not trying to extend our jurisdiction .
What we are aiming at is better allocation of the resources that will be available to us between now and 1999 , and this applies equally to the structural funds and to the transeuropean networks .
I am surprised , incidentally , that no Member has yet mentioned the question of the transeuropean networks , a question that has arisen at every European Council .
We do not want more money .
That is our approach , and it is within that framework that we specifically want to implement , step by step and in the context of an overall strategy , all the elements of the 1993 White Paper .
Mr President , I must ask Commission President Santer to elucidate two points relating to the communication concerning the employment pact .
You said that the Commission is to launch a joint pact in which the parties will be compelled to participate in the confidence pact .
However , criticism is in fact growing among economists , among politicians and , above all , among the general public .
So , what kind of consensus is it , Mr President ?
Is there not rather a yawning chasm separating us from anything resembling consensus ?
Mr President , as far as the first question is concerned , we certainly do not want to compel the social partners to reach an agreement - quite the reverse .
There is no question whatever of constraint , at any stage .
There is no question at all of constraint , quite the reverse .
This is a matter of considered approach .
I can assure you , the social partners whom I have met in all the Member States , without exception , are ready to meet this challenge .
They are ready to commit themselves because they are the parties most closely concerned , and they are aware of the challenge that has to be met in the interests of tomorrow 's society .
As far as the second question is concerned , it is of course true that economic and monetary union is one of the crucial elements for completing the internal market .
I know of no other internal market in the world - as we are the largest - with 370 million inhabitants - that functions with 14 different currencies .
We need to realize clearly what that means .
That is the aim of monetary union .
Monetary union as such is not an end in itself ; it is the instrument of a policy of economic and social development .
That is how we need to think of it .
And that is the spirit of the commitment we must enter into .
We must do away with the idea that monetary union is the enemy of employment .
Quite the reverse .
I speak as Parliament 's rapporteur on the 1996 annual economic report and on the broad economic guidelines .
I notice that the President of the Commission referred to reduction in working time , not adaptation of working time .
Mr President , I do of course believe that these matters form an entity within the discussion and must be taken into consideration .
When you read our communication , you will find these matters examined in the context of greater flexibility for our employment market .
We believe that it is necessary to ensure that flexibility is reconciled with security - some people have called this ' flexisecurity ' .
I think this is a matter that needs to be taken into account .
It goes without saying that I am also in favour of reducing the cost of labour , but we shall then have to see how these costs are replaced by other measures , other means .
Mr President , President Santer has set out an argument which at the end of the day , as far as I am concerned , represents a voluntary declaration , with specific objectives to be achieved .
But I have been asking myself a question , and now I am going to ask President Santer the same question .
And you yourself , today , are speaking in the name of competitiveness and proposing to combat unemployment in that name .
First , Mr President , it is important to realize that competitiveness is not the enemy of employment .
I state that categorically .
Quite the reverse .
Unless you strengthen the competitiveness of a business , you will not increase the number of jobs in the medium and long term .
Indeed , the objective today is to strengthen the competitiveness of European business so that it can create new jobs , jobs for the future .
That is the essence of our policy , which is designed to alleviate the sickness from which Europe is now suffering .
We are suffering from having lost market shares around the world , because our companies are not as competitive as those in other regions .
That is why we have to boost competitiveness , but in conjunction with the transition to employment .
It is not competitiveness that is killing off jobs , but there is a need to find the link between competitiveness and the creation of new jobs .
That is what we are trying to achieve in Chapter 3 of our communication , which I invite you to study very thoroughly .
Mr President , my question relates to the Swedish debate and the Swedish Government 's proposal for an employment union .
Personally , I think it is an excellent idea .
Mr President , I can tell the honourable Member that we are in full agreement with the proposals made on this matter by the Swedish Government in the context of the intergovernmental conference .
I had the opportunity to discuss this subject with the Swedish Prime Minister .
The Commission supports the Swedish proposals which are not in conflict with the objectives of convergence as laid down .
Within that framework , we must strengthen and definitively establish , at the intergovernmental conference , the follow-up procedure regarding the five points agreed on at Essen .
By doing so , we will achieve a better balance between the internal market on the one hand and the social aspect on the other , to live up to our citizens ' expectations .
The Swedish proposals are on the same lines as the proposals we ourselves made for the benefit of the intergovernmental conference .
I welcome President Santer 's discussion of the role of cities , towns and regions in the economic reconstruction of Europe .
Is your announcement of pilot towns and cities mere window-dressing or will it unleash the potential of those towns and cities throughout Europe to contribute to the process of economic development ?
Finally , will there be new money which will go to our towns and cities and which will help them unleash that potential to put people back to work ?
Mr President , I do indeed believe that we should be moving more towards regional pacts and municipal pacts .
In a number of cases the Member States have had highly encouraging experience of this , through a gradual process of decentralization of employment .
I hope that we will be able to obtain initial approval of these regional pacts when they are presented by the Commission at the European Council in Dublin .
We shall be making appropriate proposals about this to you when the time comes .
I believe that the local development initiatives must be of overriding importance .
Ladies and gentlemen , that ends Question Time .
I thank everyone who took part , especially the President of the Commission , Mr Santer , who addressed us and answered our questions this afternoon .
I shall now take a point of order from Mr Holm .
Mr President , that is the second time you have called me by the wrong name .
I believe it is reasonable to expect the Members who are in the Bureau to know each other 's names !
My name is Voggenhuber .
I accept your criticism .
I am sorry , but in the papers I have here your name and the number of your seat do not correspond .
Mistakes can easily happen in that situation .
I do apologize .
You have let some fifteen speakers take the floor .
The ladies and gentlemen who have been watching me here over the past few months will know that I am not short-sighted on the left or the right side but on both sides !
There are a great many Members who raise their hands 15 times and more during Question Time to no avail , because the number of prospective questioners - thankfully - exceeds the number of question slots .
Agreement with Morocco - Human rights in Morocco and Western Sahara
Mr President , Morocco is a very important State to us .
We need only look at the map to realize how important it is , with one coastline on the Atlantic and another on the Mediterranean .
There are also political factors .
Throughout that entire area we should be defending the forces of moderation against extremism and strengthening them .
Quite apart from that , we also have numerous cultural points in common .
Anyone travelling across Spain today on the way to Morocco , through Seville and on to Marrakesh , for example , will observe that the Kutubiyah Mosque is very similar to the Giralda .
The Jewish , Islamic and Christian religions were represented there simultaneously , as can surely be recognized in the Cathedral of Toledo .
So we have various reasons for developing our common ground with Morocco .
It is said time and again about Morocco , of course , that there are human rights abuses in that country .
I do not deny that ; it is undoubtedly the case .
The fact is that there are various levels of culture and development .
We should not simply say that everything has to be done in accordance with our standard .
That is why I believe that Morocco is really entitled to our attention , that we should make serious efforts to provide Morocco with the necessary connections and give it tangible support .
The Sahara question is also aired very frequently .
I think I am probably the only one here in Parliament who can say that I made my first visit to the Sahara more than fifty years ago .
There is no particular merit in that ; I am , after all , the grandfather of this Parliament .
But it does enable me to say one thing , namely that I can see the developments that have taken place there .
When people speak today about voters and registration of voters , they should be fully aware of the situation .
There have been repeated calls to proceed on the basis of a particular register that was drawn up back in the Spanish era .
That would be totally wrong .
Many new settlers have arrived since then , and their contribution has been truly enormous .
Here in Europe we still consider it unthinkable to eject people who helped to build our continent .
We should bear that in mind in relation to the Sahara too .
Then , of course , the old arguments against Islam are trotted out time and again , with repeated references to what happened in Iran at the time of Khomeini .
The various shades of opinion within Islam must not simply be lumped together ; it must be recognized that there are various groups within Islam and that many of them merit our respect .
There are , however , many who oppose it simply because they are basically racists but who do not have the courage to admit that openly .
This is a fine piece of camouflage under which they introduce this additional factor into the equation .
That is why we should really encourage Morocco .
We should accept this agreement , which , incidentally , has been very well negotiated , and we should recognize in particular that if we want to work together there ought to be a certain spirit of friendly openness .
There is an old German proverb which says that flies are not caught with vinegar but with honey .
May I ask the House to take that message to heart and to open the door to the Moroccans .
They really do deserve it .
We want to support the moderate Islamic states , and above all we want to make the Mediterranean a region of peace .
The Commission thinks that no-one of good will can deny the substantial progress made in recent years on the subject of human rights in Morocco .
The pace of the reforms , their content or their speed leave room for discussion .
Of course that does not mean that it has reached a situation which can be regarded as perfect .
And the Moroccan authorities themselves , in their political dialogue with the Commission , acknowledge in fact that the desired level of observance of human rights has not yet been reached .
They know too that progress must be made in this matter .
This year , 1996 , is decisive for the Moroccan constitutional system .
So parliamentary democracy is , in this very year , 1996 , at the centre of the Moroccan internal debate .
I have myself visited the Moroccan Parliament and have been able to appreciate the intensity of this reform phenomenon , which it is proposed to implement during the second half year .
There are two political approaches to this situation : one is to go on criticizing ; the other is to engage in dialogue and to promote this kind of change which is so fundamental in the Moroccan constitution .
The second sensitive issue is the Western Sahara .
The Commission has always contended that the initiative and leadership with regard to the Western Sahara is a matter for the United Nations .
That has always seemed to us the natural setting in which possible negotiations should take place .
The Commission regrets that Security Council decision , but it is a fact that Minurso , further reduced , will continue its duties of monitoring the cease-fire .
I imagine that the European Union 's position will depend on the final report which the Secretary General of the United Nations has to draw up , to be submitted , as you know , on 31 August .
Mr President , we thank the Vice-President of the Commission , Mr Marín , for the detailed explanations he has given us .
The opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations is to a large extent based on some of the aspects he has mentioned , for example :
We are thankful for the effort Morocco has made in this direction .
The European Union has demonstrated its political will .
With all this in mind the Committee on External Economic Relations has given its approval with an opinion in favour of the association agreement between the European Union and Morocco .
We must pay attention to the point made by both the Commissioner and the rapporteur , stressing the basic geostrategic situation of the Kingdom of Morocco .
And we must appreciate the desirability of mutual understanding between two cultures - European and Moroccan in this case - for establishing important collaboration .
We must not forget sources of energy vital to the European Union necessarily pass through Morocco .
We therefore heartily applaud the association agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco .
Morocco at present is calling insistently at the gates of the European Union for help to achieve economic growth .
However , demographic growth there is unstoppable and , if it is not accompanied by job creation , the pressure of migration will continue to rise , with all the accompanying problems .
This involves moving to a new strategic equilibrium in the external relations of the European Union after the priority given to the central and eastern European countries in recent years .
In fact the stability of Europe 's southern flank affects the whole Union , and not just the more geographically exposed Member States .
Secondly , the deadlock on the independence referendum for the Saharan people . A few weeks ago the latest Amnesty International report stated that the Moroccan security forces in Western Sahara have carried out serious violations of human rights .
Condemning this is not a form of racism .
In addition , Amnesty states that the Moroccan government is showing no intention of investigating these violations .
The committee also calls on the Polisario Front to seize the opportunity for peace that exists and continue along the path of dialogue and contact with the United Nations .
However , whilst no question arises as to the raison d ' être of that agreement , it must be mentioned that the sardine processing sector is a real martyr to that agreement .
As a result the Committee on Fisheries in its opinion has recommended certain priority measures to the competent Community bodies . Amongst them the following should be stressed :
Welcome
I welcome them here and extend to them my best wishes for successful work with us .
Agreement with Morocco - Human Rights in Morocco and Western Sahara ( continuation )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the economic and geostrategic importance of the association agreement on which we are being asked to vote is obvious .
So I will talk about other aspects .
Once again , we find ourselves in a position to measure our hopes against the hard yardstick of reality .
Reconciling these factors is difficult .
No one is perfect .
In our case , these values and forms of behaviour took nearly 200 years to come into existence .
In the Islamic cultural sphere , the movement to introduce democracy began much more recently .
We can reasonably criticize those who reject it , but not those who are merely lagging behind .
Its closest rivals in the progression towards international standards of democracy are the two kingdoms of Jordan and Morocco . Are we going to treat Morocco as if it was Iraq ?
Do we want to support the reactionary Islamic forces within that country which are opposing closer links with the West , even trade links ?
Mr President , for us the approval of the Euro-Maghreb agreement under discussion today has the greatest importance .
On the other hand this represents a demand put forward years ago by the European Parliament and particularly by its Committees on Foreign Affairs and on Development and Cooperation .
The agreement we are discussing has an economic and commercial content , aimed fundamentally at the economic and social development of the Kingdom of Morocco and the growth of economic and commercial relations between Morocco and the European Union .
With this are being created the conditions to fill a void in these two policies for Europe , a void which has been untenable up to now .
True , there is the painful aspect of human rights .
And it is right to demand that they be strictly protected and also demand the acceleration of the process of democratic reform .
We owe it to ourselves however also to take account of the fact that the persistence of conditions that are not at all satisfactory runs parallel to the existence of a risk of serious emergency .
We shall therefore vote against this association agreement between the European Union and Morocco .
How sad it is to hear in this House that progress has been made because a few political prisoners have been released !
How sad to hear in this House that there is less infringement of human rights !
Mr President , the Green Group will vote against this proposal .
I cannot accept the inverted racism which means that the suppression of freedom in Arab countries is acceptable on account of their culture and traditions .
Those who take this line are no true friends of the Arab world .
For us Western Sahara is a crucial point .
The question is when it will be appropriate to enter into an association agreement with Morocco .
The Security Council recently decided to extend the Minurso mandate in the hope that it will be possible to resume identification work .
In that connection the Security Council particularly stressed that Saharan political prisoners in Morocco must be released .
There should be no doubt about that .
It would also be an insult to the legitimate battle for freedom being conducted by the people of Western Sahara .
The fact is that there are two factors that can militate against the adoption of the text before us today .
The basic freedoms , those formal freedoms that our communist comrades used to talk about , are still granted grudgingly , if at all .
To be resolutely hostile to government policy is no sinecure , no kind of picnic at all .
All these things are still true but , to be a little more specific , they are becoming less and less true .
And we need to help our democratic friends in Morocco to ensure that these things are no longer true at all .
We should note though , in passing , that those who vow to bring down the regime and the Moroccan kingdom are not all apostles of liberty - far from it .
The ' green march ' and the de facto annexation of the territory more than 20 years ago have led to results that cannot be accepted as things stand .
Clearly , it is necessary to consult the views of the people .
But to accuse Morocco of sabotaging the referendum process is simplistic , to put it mildly .
Let us be close to the Moroccans .
Let us move even closer to them .
It may be good business , but it is certainly right .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Parliament has to be realistic .
Since the first days of independence , Morocco has pursued a dual objective : defending its own identity while developing in partnership with Europe .
This bold and courageous choice was not , and is not , free of risk for the policy makers who made that choice and are still pursuing it .
The stability of Morocco cannot be taken for granted : it is the product of the determination of Morocco 's rulers , and our cooperation has its part to play there .
By supporting this kind of development , then , we shall at the same time be helping to combat illegal immigration .
Development , stability , openness , progress towards democracy even if that progress is sometimes hesitant - all these trends at any rate deserve our encouragement and support .
We have an opportunity to express that encouragement and support clearly and specifically by approving Mr von Habsburg 's report and the association agreement upon which we are being asked to vote .
Let us not miss that opportunity .
Yet the association agreement you are offering us gives rise to serious reservations on our part , the same reservations that we have entered in all similar cases .
Ladies and gentlemen , before we presume to give lessons to the King of Morocco , let us start by putting our own house in order .
In many ways , there is more freedom of expression in Morocco than there is in Europe .
So the Moroccans can do without your lessons on the right way to behave , as can we .
The main thrust of our reservations concerns the underlying nature of the Maastricht system .
It is presented as being a stabilizing factor in Moroccan society .
If the European Union were to produce that effect , it would be something new .
What about your political imperialism , the arrogance of our subculture , the destruction of our spiritual values ?
Do you want to impose all that on Morocco ?
The second reason relates to Title VI and Article 64 : the alignment of the rights of Moroccan nationals with those of our own nationals .
Clearly , Moroccans do have rights abroad , just as foreigners have rights in Morocco .
But it seems to us that those rights should be determined by ordinary international civil law .
We have just been talking about unemployment in Europe .
As far as this is concerned , the corrective factors referred to in Article 71 are unlikely to be much of a barrier .
Thirdly , we have always believed that the European Union should confine itself to a European political , economic and cultural area .
If not , and it is embarrassing to have to make such obvious points , it ceases to be a European entity and becomes one step on the road towards the construction of a global entity .
Here Morocco plays a very important part as a bridge between the Maghreb and the Union .
In the past few years a cautious beginning has been made in the sphere of democracy .
Commissioner Marín has just confirmed that .
Admittedly it is all a small start .
Only a critical dialogue with all levels of Moroccan society can bring closer the advancement of the State governed by the rule of law which we so keenly wish to see .
Above all to approve it in order to avoid even the slightest risk of seeing Morocco slide down into an Algerian situation .
That must be avoided .
I have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
For those reasons therefore this agreement may be approved .
It is this last point , the creation of a region of peace and prosperity , that I would like to stress .
As far as the Kingdom of Morocco is concerned , we want to encourage it to pursue its economic reforms and political liberalization .
Provision is in fact made for a regular political dialogue to be set up between our Union and the Kingdom of Morocco .
And , within that dialogue , respect for human rights and principles of democracy will play an essential part .
Mr President , the Euromediterranean agreements may help to strengthen cooperation with the Mediterranean countries , and I am in favour of them .
But they must find expression in genuine cooperation , based on mutual advantage and free of any thought of domination .
I have to say that they are too much dictated by the ultraliberal logic of creating competition between economies and nations , based on free trade and the free movement of capital .
Furthermore , the agreements cannot be confined to financial and commercial aspects , leaving aside the questions of democracy and human rights .
Undeniably , significant results have been achieved by Morocco in this field , thanks to the international mobilization of opinion to which this House made a powerful contribution .
Prisoners have been released , missing persons have emerged from their secret prisons , yet there is still much to do before it can be said that human rights are really being respected .
The situation in Western Sahara , which was one of the main reasons this House rejected the financial protocol with Morocco in 1992 , has not improved . The Moroccan government is still pursuing its policy of obstructiveness .
Unfortunately , it is enjoying the tacit support of certain Member States and of the United Nations , whose Secretary General has just decided to suspend the process of elector identification .
But there are differences .
Libya , for instance , is not one of the states involved in the MEDA programme .
Morocco differs from the other Mediterranean states in that it has occupied the Western Sahara .
The European Parliament has always taken a clear and unequivocal position on Morocco and the Western Sahara .
The realization of the Sahrawi people 's right to self-determination has always been a matter of priority for us .
We bear special political responsibility here too .
The Sahrawi people have lived in refugee camps for 20 years .
That is the result of an irresponsible policy pursued in the postcolonial era .
That we should give humanitarian aid to the refugees and to the refugee camps is therefore a dictate of our humanity and part of our historical obligation .
But before we can sign or approve this agreement here today , we need a political solution for the Western Sahara , and that means Moroccan withdrawal from the Western Sahara .
The peace process was a good start .
The ceasefire agreement was important .
But the referendum is also important to us .
Some people are still saying that dialogue is needed .
We can see how dialogue works in the wake of the agreement with Turkey .
There is dialogue .
There are Spanish and French tourist organizations represented in Morocco , there are fisheries , arms exports , police training in Germany .
We want peace in the Mediterranean Basin , but only on condition that Morocco demonstrates real commitment to it .
Otherwise we advocate waiting until the referendum has actually taken place .
But that must not prevent us from drawing attention to the human rights situation in that country .
I am thinking above all of cases of persecution of religious minorities , particularly Christians .
Only recently we received information about that from the European Evangelical Alliance .
That is remarkable because religious freedom is basically guaranteed in Morocco , which has also signed various international human rights conventions .
There therefore appears to be a serious discrepancy between the national authorities ' policy of tolerance and the application of that policy by the local authorities .
It must be discussed with the national authorities .
In addition Morocco must show signs of greater cooperation as regards Moroccans wanting to return from Europe to their home country .
Returning is not at present an attractive prospect since the Moroccan authorities do hardly anything in the way of reception and guidance .
In spite of what I have said we shall give our support to the association agreement .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at this stage of the proceedings perhaps I may concentrate on the salient points of this debate , because actually we are asked for an opinion on the association agreement with Morocco .
I must say very clearly that the most important thing is its historic significance .
The fact that this agreement is going to have to be ratified by the 15 Parliaments of the Member States of the Union may give us an idea of its parliamentary importance .
But , ladies and gentlemen , let us give it a chance and let us have patience to sort things out .
We are speaking about an agreement which has not yet come into being .
It is an agreement looking towards the future .
Everything in it relates to commitments for the immediate short- , medium- or long-term future .
It is an association agreement designed to bring about a different state of affairs .
Let us not fall into the trap of turning this into a test for good behaviour .
On the contrary , it is a question of making this association agreement what it is : a means of overcoming the past and taking a step towards a new situation in the future .
How odd that the extreme parliamentary Groups on both sides should finally agree on the same position , by different routes but both of them on a negative vote !
Let us look towards progress !
Let us vote in favour !
Mr President , this agreement with Morocco is a good example of lack of transparency .
In addition , in the case of this agreement there are other weighty reasons for rejecting it .
To start with political reasons , notably the systematic procrastination and undermining of international decisions on the independence of the Sahara ; it also has a profoundly unbalanced economy .
We reject the hypocrisy of those who state that these are economically unimportant sectors .
Mr President , we all want to strengthen our links with Morocco .
We admire the courage and energy of our many Moroccan friends , including the Moroccan MPs who are with us yet again in Parliament , with whom we have a very active dialogue .
If Morocco had spent a fraction of the time it has spent on lobbying the European Parliament on cooperating with the peace process in the Western Sahara , the conflict and suffering would have ended many years ago .
I should like to congratulate Mr von Habsburg , our colleague who describes Morocco as a plural democracy .
He has again shown he is a good friend of the King of Morocco and , unfortunately , an apologist for the illegal occupation of the Western Sahara by Morocco .
( Applause )
Mr President , I shall vote , with conviction and hope for the future , in favour of this report .
In view of Spain 's subsequent experience I am in favour of this agreement and of support for the most active sectors of society .
Of course I feel , like so many others , frustration at the present situation of the conflict in the Sahara .
But I think that this agreement is one step further in that most important process initiated in Barcelona and we must welcome that .
Oh yes , I like lots of other countries and lots of other people !
We need this stability ; we need economic , institutional and cultural ties with the Mediterranean .
That is true .
And especially with Morocco , that is even more true .
I would like to dwell on the two points which are causing a problem .
First human rights , and then of course the reference to Turkey .
A fortnight ago we were very dubious , and every day we worried that we may have been wrong .
The situation is not the same for those who know the Moroccan people .
And in fact I think it is not the same for those who know the history of that ancient land , that ancient people , that ancient kingdom and , I would say , that young nation .
No , it is not the same .
Let us bank on it being very different .
Then , of course , there is also the matter of the Saharans .
I have no great enthusiasm for the way they are being treated , I must say , by Algeria and in the camps with which I am familiar .
I have no great enthusiasm for it - quite the reverse .
But I know that they fought courageously .
I know that some of them are deeply sincere , and I know that causes a problem .
But I have read the documents , the document that the Saharans have just sent us , the document that the Moroccan Socialist Opposition has passed to us , and Mr Boutros Ghali 's document .
And I believe that neither side can be accused of 100 % responsibility for blocking the peace process .
Let us put our trust in the UN .
Let us keep the pressure on .
This referendum is necessary .
Let us not abandon the Saharans .
Certainly not !
I am taking this gamble , yes , because I believe that there are times in politics when we should follow the dictates of our hearts because our heads are not sure of the way .
That is why my vote will be in favour of the Moroccans .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
Non-admission of Croatia to the Council of Europe
The next item is the statement by the Council on the non-admission of Croatia to the Council of Europe .
Mr President , it will not surprise this President-in-Office of the Council that I entirely agree with him .
My Group was indignant about the proposal from the Assembly of the Council of Europe to admit Croatia , albeit conditionally , as a full member of the Council of Europe .
It looked as though that country was to be rewarded for its part in the peace process , and as though political arguments thus played a large part in the proposal then made .
But that would amount to toying with human rights criteria by the Council Assembly whereas the Council of Europe 's most important task is to put human rights to the test .
In our view Croatia , or must we say the Croatian Government , does not at present meet the criteria .
Not long since , the President refused to accept the democratically elected mayor of Zagreb and did everything in his power to prevent the appointment .
The independent media are seriously hampered in Croatia , and as has been said , the situation of the refugees and the minorities is very unsatisfactory .
There are thus reasons enough for keeping up the pressure on the Croatian Government .
That actually applies as well to Croatia 's role in the peace process .
My Group supports the policy of the Council of Europe 's Committee of Ministers to defer a decision about the admission of Croatia .
We welcome the response of the European Union . We are also glad that the Political Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe supports this proposal .
We shall follow developments closely and we ask the Council of Europe to keep us informed of its findings in the coming months .
And more generally we shall follow closely the Council of Europe 's admission policy .
Previously we debated the admission of the Russian Federation to the Council of Europe .
I also think it is disturbing that the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe came close to adopting opposite views on this matter .
If this Parliament and the Assembly of the Council of Europe are going to interpret criteria differently we shall have a serious problem .
I hope the content of the European Parliament 's resolution will cause our colleagues there to think again .
We in the European People 's Party and the Group of the European People 's Party support Croatia and its people , as well as its Parliament and Government , in this aspiration .
On the other hand , we know that the only way to their goal involves complete democratization .
Like all other states of central Europe , Croatia must establish the same democratic rights and rules of play that apply in the countries of the European Union itself .
Croatia has already made great progress towards becoming a democratic and pluralist society .
In the peace process it has taken a moderate line , and its position is now one of commitment to peaceful solutions .
The economic and social groups - employers , trade unions and the other associations - are free and active .
Croatia , in our opinion , is pursuing a prudent economic and monetary policy .
Most of the conditions are in place for reconstruction to be carried out in a climate of stability .
However , now that hostilities have largely ceased , we want the Croatian Government itself to keep all the rules of democracy .
Freedom of the press and respect for democratic decisions and election results at all levels are indispensable prerequisites .
We are opposed to discriminatory treatment of Croatia in the domain of human rights .
For the municipal government of Zagreb too , a solution must be found which is politically sound and which respects the outcome of democratic elections .
The European Union , for its part , should do everything possible to ensure that the resources available under the PHARE programme are committed at long last to the specific aims of developing the economy and democracy .
To sum up , we believe that the ball is now in the Croatian court .
So it is urgent to make this stand and it is right to make it firm and clear .
We are in favour of conditional cooperation with Croatia , which must provide further guarantees of the irreversible democratic development of its institutions .
When this Parliament approved the extension of the PHARE programme to Croatia , it was unanimously made conditional on respect for democratic principles .
So I believe the Council , and especially the Commission , should not hesitate to demand the suspension of PHARE if Zagreb continues in the direction it has taken .
On this last point I ask the President-in-Office of the Council to make the position clear to ensure that later , as we all hope , we can proceed to the agreements .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Green Group entirely agrees with the Council of Europe 's Committee of Ministers in their decision provisionally to defer acceptance of Croatia as a member of that Council .
There is indeed every reason for doing so .
More than a year ago it was already decided in this Parliament by a considerable majority that there were serious problems in connection with democratic execution of policy in Croatia .
So that is why we say : we agree about looking very carefully at developments in the future .
But Croatia 's application needs to be assessed on its own merits .
Otherwise the credibility of the Council of Europe would be still further impaired .
It is generally known that the protection of fundamental freedoms in Croatia still leaves a good deal to be desired .
The media are under severe restraint and the independence of the judiciary is not guaranteed .
In addition President Tudjman 's conduct is controversial and there is little cooperation with the International Tribunal on war crimes .
But the state of the peace process in the former Yugoslavia above all makes us cautious for the present .
Compliance with Croatia 's application might moreover act as a precedent with regard to Bosnia and what is left of Yugoslavia .
So , although we think that Croatia must be able to join the Council of Europe , we can agree with the decision to defer it provisionally .
As far back as 1991 Europe 's leaders had refused to recognize the independence of that country , which was then freeing itself from the federal and socialist yoke of Yugoslavia .
They did not allow that nation to join the international Community until January 1992 , when a third of its territory was occupied by the Yugoslav federal army .
Today , Croatia has gained its freedom , but it is still not in good odour with this House or with the Council of Europe .
Indeed , the Council of Europe is refusing to allow Croatia to join the club .
The reason cited is the Croatian government 's failure to respect human rights , in particular freedom of the press .
As if those principles were applied in every one of the thirty-nine member states !
Is freedom of the press , or even freedom of elections , better respected in Russia than in Croatia ?
It 's doubtful , to say the least .
As if that were not enough , the journalist in question is seriously ill .
These appalling events happened not in Zagreb but in Paris .
So perhaps it is time for European governments to respect human rights at home instead of being so fussy about what happens elsewhere .
I should also like to mention the subject of the minorities .
The problem of the treatment of minorities in Croatia is serious and must be solved urgently in relation to those who have left .
Moreover I think that the involvement of Croatia in Herzegovina and in support for the bands of mafiosi and ultra-radical fascists operating in the region of Herzegovina will not escape anyone who knows Bosnia .
Croatia has a direct responsibility for that and only by the will of Croatia can the present situation be prevented from dragging on .
Finally I should like to say that equally firm , but different , measures will have to be applied to Serbia .
Mr President , it is a pity that Mrs Aelvoet had to finish before she needed to .
We find it particularly disappointing and it is also particularly displeasing to us , to the European Union , that the Council of Europe no longer acts as that kind of hallmark .
That is why we as a Group take such an interest in paragraph 5 of the resolution in which the Council of Europe is requested to state what its accession policy actually is .
If there are alterations we should be glad to hear of them .
To some extent when it comes to enlarging the European Union we are a little dependent on the policy they follow .
Then we naturally think of Turkey , of Russia and sometimes of other countries too .
We always have mixed feelings about Croatia .
Mr President , there is increasing confusion in this Chamber and Parliament 's credibility is evaporating fast .
Turkey 's customs union with Europe has not been assessed with equal seriousness and objectivity !
But unfortunately these are not the only contradictions in this Parliament : human rights come second to the interests of the few and I am afraid hypocrisy triumphs .
Mr President , the decision to postpone admission of Croatia to the Council of Europe is important and correct .
It is important that the countries which are admitted to the Council of Europe respect the fundamental rules and principles which the institution is in fact there to safeguard .
Croatia at present does not do this .
Anything else would completely undermine the Council of Europe 's credibility .
There are also extremely worrying developments in Croatia as regards press freedom .
In practice , the government is attempting to silence those critical newspapers which exist .
This applies to Novi list , which is published in Rijeka , the only independent daily newspaper left .
Such provisions are totally inappropriate in a democratic state .
Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights stipulates that freedom of expression shall be guaranteed .
Croatia is unfortunately not complying with this provision , and we therefore support the decision not to admit the country to the Council of Europe at present .
Mr President , along with Mr Mendiluce Pereiro I went to Bosnia last week to study the situation for myself .
We travelled by road from Croatia into the state of Bosnia .
As we entered Bosnia we saw a huge election poster for President Tudjman of Croatia .
At first I thought this was a mistake but the deeper we went into the Bosnian state the more we saw of these huge posters .
They symbolized the extent to which President Tudjman is prepared to ignore the Dayton accords and is prepared to fulfil his own agenda in undermining the peace agreement in Bosnia .
Obviously the international community cannot ignore such deliberate defiance .
I support the decision taken by the Council of Europe .
We want to see the return of refugees and we want to see free and fair elections .
The essential prerequisite for free and fair elections is a free media .
This is manifestly not in existence on the Croatian side .
Therefore I support this decision by the Council of Europe .
Mr President , Croatia is an emergent democracy , and that is why we support the demands made by the Council .
Allow me , however , to address the President-in-Office of the Council and to put to him the urgent plea that the Council apply the same yardsticks , the same criteria .
I was the rapporteur on Romania for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe .
The list of unfulfilled demands made by the Council of Europe was far longer than the list referred to here for Croatia .
Yet Romania was admitted , and of course is now under obligation to meet these requirements gradually .
The same terms , I submit , must be granted to Romania .
The same criteria must be applied here , and that is why Mr Oostlander and Mr Schwaiger have both cited point 5 of the resolution .
There is no point in trying to be more Catholic than the Pope here .
Thank you for those speeches . I have taken note of the points made and the presidency will make sure the Council is informed .
I just want to emphasize two points here .
To do this we must be capable of sustaining and assisting the process .
I think we should take the same attitude towards every country engaged in transition .
I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
Elections in Albania
The next item is the statement by the Council on the elections in Albania .
Members are naturally aware of the progress of events so I do not need to go over what has happened in the last few weeks in Albania .
It seems to me that these considerations lead to two conclusions , which I set out here for Members .
We need to understand what is going on and what is likely to happen , so the view I have expressed today will have to be updated later .
The elections in Albania were a fiasco .
I think we may say that the Albanian Government may also be held responsible for the way in which those elections were conducted .
There were serious irregularities .
We heard of intimidation and any protest at the way things were going was put down with violence .
We think the elections were simply not fair and most observers agree .
Political life was made impossible for the opposition .
It is understandable that they are prepared to not work in a fraudulently elected parliament .
President Berisha may be held personally responsible for this tragedy .
He creates the impression that he is busy trying to consolidate an autocratic regime as if Albania had not had enough of that .
With that he is forcing his country afresh into isolation .
The Council 's first appraisal is very reserved . They want to wait to see what official reports bring in the next few weeks .
So the Council is not willing to go further in its assessment than is the case today . That is also why we are getting no answer to all our questions .
Mr President , unlike Mr Wiersma I am quite favourably impressed by the answer from the presidency of the Council .
I think it is very fair to wait and see what developments the next few days bring .
This Council presidency has clearly pinpointed the sensitive areas and has spoken of the need for a possible partial re-run of the elections in some districts .
There are indications that the Council may also quite likely be able to give a more detailed commentary at the next plenary part-session as Mr Wiersma asked .
Of course Albania has been a problem for us all for a long time .
True , it is a small country , and it is close at hand , but as regards development it is still a country which is a long way down on the list of world powers .
Naturally that goes hand in hand with a very badly developed public administration .
We must take that into account .
We see that the idea of the public interest on which a different view might perhaps be taken , actually hardly exists .
That of course does not mean that we must resign ourselves to it .
I wonder whether it would not be useful for the Commission to give Parliament a policy report with regard to a country like Albania .
But in that sphere too - we have just had the experience with Croatia -it is particularly necessary for PHARE democracy funds to be used to the best advantage .
Help with legislation , training and extra contact are all matters in which we can take care that such pitiful things as the abortive or half-abortive elections in Albania can no longer take place .
I should be glad to hear the Commission 's view and possibly those of the Council as well .
I think that we owe that to the Albanian people and that it is the only proper way to proceed .
Examples of all this have already been given in the debate we had in Strasbourg .
Opening hours for polling stations were extended during voting and then changed by the various chairmen . During the count valid ballot papers were declared void .
That is why I am asking for pressure to be put on Albania to re-run the elections and the Greens will table a motion along those lines at Strasbourg .
So it is important for the political dialogue to be geared precisely to understanding what is going on .
So we need to begin a careful evaluation , be present on the ground and see if there is some way we can intervene .
So that is what we think is important , before making any choice , ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I have listened to honourable Members but , if I may say so , I have the impression that honourable Members did not listen to me !
So I would like to take a few minutes to confirm the position I have maintained on behalf of the presidency of the European Union .
Whether or not there was ballot-rigging is not in question .
It says in my report - and I said so in my speech - that the elections were marked by widespread and general ballot-rigging , and voting and counting irregularities .
Our problem is not to decide whether the elections were properly conducted or not , because I do not think they were properly conducted .
The problem is to find the most effective and appropriate strategy now to end this crisis .
I think it would be legitimate to say that the best thing to do is re-run the whole election , but the question is how do we get a decision to re-run the election ?
That is the real question !
It is not enough for us to say that the election must be re-run .
If we say the election must be re-run and one of the parties involved refuses , we are immediately left without a strategy .
And the crisis gets more and more acute and serious !
When I spoke of political dialogue I was not using that formula to suggest a generic methodological formula valid for all occasions and all political situations .
No !
And personally I think one of the things to be discussed in this setting is precisely whether it is possible to agree a re-run of the election .
But the political problem is not just to form judgements or set up objectives , it is primarily to establish the route to certain objectives .
I do not think it is our role to minimize criticism of this election but , at the same time , we must implement effective and necessary strategies to help overcome this crisis .
So I think it is important to see what happens in the next few days .
Mr President , since Mr Oostlander has addressed himself to the Commission I should like to mention one or two points in answer .
Secondly , there is also a Community project with the Council of Europe to try to launch a real reform of the judicial system from a democratic point of view .
So that seems to me to be worth while .
Those are two pieces of information which I wanted to give , but I should like to end with a general political reflection .
There must naturally be no doubt at all that the further development of relations between Albania and the European Union depends essentially and crucially upon the quality of the democratic process .
It must be made clear to Albania that naturally the European Union cannot go further with that project unless that distorted situation which now undoubtedly exists is set democratically to rights in one way or another .
Obviously there must be a pragmatic approach , but there must be no doubt that the democratic process must be substantially correct so that the European Union may continue with its efforts .
The debate is closed .
Common transport policy - action programme 1995-2000
The progress Europe has achieved throughout its history has been founded on the quality and extent of its communications networks .
Transport demand has experienced virtually uninterrupted growth since the 1970s ; with the creation of the single market and the free movement of persons and goods , it is destined to grow even more .
Without an efficient , accessible and competitive transport system , the European Union as a whole will be unable to pursue its social and economic development in a harmonious and balanced manner .
In short , the basic aims of the European Union will be unattainable .
Fourthly , there is a need to develop a genuine transport culture , promoting educational programmes in schools on the use of means of transport , safety and respect for the rules .
I think this report represents a firm and precise starting point for the future of transport .
Actually it is a report about major harmonization of the infrastructure of our European Union , about priority political choices , rules and conduct in the area of transport .
Madam President the objectives of this action programme must be to offer basic mobility to all citizens without damaging nature and the environment .
From this definition it is clear that our current transport policies are unsustainable and need a radical shift in direction .
Yet this communication adopts a business-asusual approach , regardless of the dangers of current trends .
The Environment Committee is particularly concerned about the impact of road transport on the environment .
At present , cars and lorries are responsible for about a quarter of the European Union 's CO2 emissions .
Clearly what is needed are EU-wide targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions in the transport sector .
To be fair , the Commission does talk about the necessary shift of traffic from the roads .
But integrating the environment into transport policy must be more consistent and more focused .
Principles already in place , like the polluter-pays and precautionary principles must be part of all transport legislation .
All the Commission has for the period 1997-2000 in this action programme are three proposals on air transport and one on maritime transport .
However , the planned environment proposals are very welcome , as are the recently published Green Papers on the citizens ' network and the internalization of external costs .
The latter proposal , in particular , should make it possible for less polluting forms of transport to compete on a more equal footing with polluting ones .
Radical and far-sighted policies are urgently needed in this sector and unfortunately there are not too many signs of those in this communication .
My committee therefore gives it qualified support .
Madam President , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , may I express our gratification that the proposals made by the Committee on Budgets are reflected in the present resolution .
Secondly , they should help to reinforce Europe 's appeal as a business location .
So it is important that we concentrate on these and do not dissipate our energies .
The second thing I welcome as an Austrian is the plan to extend the envisaged high-speed Paris-Munich rail link to Vienna .
We think , however , that it will be desirable to make a more specific approach with the inclusion of a comprehensive statistical background which in our opinion is inadequate .
As regards the financing of the trans-European transport networks , its importance is universally recognized by us all .
The networks are an essential feature of the realization of the internal market .
Their impact on employment and the social problems with which we contend every day are taking on a decisive importance .
From this point of view we feel that the instruments and financial resources necessary for giving specific expression to these objectives must be substantially increased or we risk falling irrecoverably short of the objectives we are proposing to achieve .
As regards the internalization of external costs , that is , in our opinion a matter of high priority .
The ideas outlined in the green paper on this subject show clearly what possibilities there are and they must be followed by concrete measures at the appropriate levels as soon as possible .
Madam President , I will concentrate on social aspects of this report .
We are particularly concerned about working time and how it affects the transport sector .
That was a long time ago , in fact it was 18 months ago Mr Flynn first promised us this .
He promised us it about January 1995 and we are now in June 1996 .
Our committee now feel that it is time that the Commission galvanizes us into action in this area .
We are also concerned about the TENs which other people have mentioned .
We are worried about the fact that the Edinburgh facility , the economic investment fund that was established in Edinburgh , has remained a dead letter .
This has impeded transport development , particularly infrastructure development schemes such as the west coast line in the United Kingdom and the electrified line into Glasgow airport .
Many of the other good ferry services we could have linking cross- Channel states of the Community have remained another dead letter because there has been no funding .
It is important that the Commission put some pressure on the Council to ensure there is adequate funding in this area of infrastructure .
Transport is very important for the European Union , to make sure that there is genuine freedom of movement and people and goods can go freely about the Union .
The best way to do that is by good transport links .
But we also have considerable deficits .
I shall try to focus again on something my honourable friend Mr McMahon mentioned in passing in the opinion he drafted for the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment .
We expect the relationship between harmonization and liberalization , which is still out of balance , to be kept under constant review .
I intend to emphasize very clearly at every opportunity that our pleas to this effect should be addressed primarily to the Council rather than the Commission .
We do , however , ask the Commission for its continued support in this matter .
Our social standards are still not safeguarded ; indeed , social standards are slipping , are constantly being forced downward .
We need consultations ; we need the development of consultative mechanisms so that management and labour can come up with effective legislative solutions .
The results of these discussions will naturally be fed into the preparatory phase , as well as into the agenda itself , of the third Pan-European Transport Conference , due to take place in Helsinki in 1997 .
It is a good basis .
Safety problems and the quest for environmentally acceptable solutions are actually a matter for all transport operators .
I touched briefly on external relations , and I should like to add something to that .
In particular , of course , I am thinking of air transport negotiations with the United States , for which I was appointed rapporteur .
Our honourable colleague Mr König referred to the trans-European networks .
Mr König , we have made far less progress in this area than you seemed to suggest .
Another meeting of the Conciliation Committee is currently taking place between delegations from Parliament and the Council .
The Council has scarcely budged , and at the moment the whole scheme is tending to look like a dead letter .
I should very much regret that , but the Council has to realize that there are powers of codecision involved here ; it has evidently not understood that yet .
But over and above the 14 projects , which we in Parliament certainly support , we wish to have an additional list of priority projects .
Going beyond the work of the Conciliation Committee , we naturally also want to develop a financial basis at long last .
On that we are agreed .
One of the problems at the moment is the siege mentality adopted by the Council .
The further development of a transport policy for the whole of Europe is being curbed rather than encouraged by the Council .
Without Parliament and the Commission the situation would indeed be bleak !
We require investments totalling hundreds of billions , but only a ludicrous few hundred million ecus are earmarked in our European budget .
So we must continue to assume that these tasks will primarily be undertaken by the Member States .
Mr Parodi 's report marks an important step in the series of reports on this subject and in the ongoing development of a pan-European transport policy .
In the field of railways , we would like to see a better development of the European railways .
We call specifically for the railway market to be opened up to new , private railway companies , thereby enhancing consumer choice .
In the field of air transport , it is particularly important to have a unified system of air traffic control .
We in the European People 's Party commend the report to the House , we congratulate the rapporteur and thank the Commission for this initiative .
It is consistent with the past , as Mr Lüttge has reminded us , but I think it also projects the new paths for the future .
Carrying out projects is fine and exciting , but how can that be done without the necessary funds ?
There are already grounds for satisfaction about the approach to the project in the preamble , but there is also concern because it stands on feet of clay .
The European citizen can hardly fail to be a little confused when presented with promises impossible to keep .
I remember Commissioner Kinnock telling us one day to convince our citizens that participating in the creation of these networks is a bargain .
Well , I think we need to look at this invitation again with great realism and great honesty , and first set ourselves definite , clear and transparent guidelines .
Madam President , I am a little disappointed in both the Commission action programme and the report .
There are a few things left out of the Commission 's action programme .
I think the association with environment policy is incomplete and in addition where security for example is concerned I think the response to the security problems on road transport and also on air transport does not go far enough .
Where the environment is concerned I cannot find even a reference to the aims of CO2 reduction as the European institutions themselves have previously laid them down .
How can you maintain now that you are trying to create a sustainable mobility if in an action programme like this you do not even refer to aims of that kind and indicate how they must be achieved .
Mr Parodi 's report touches upon it but unfortunately the report has become so convoluted , such a long string of demands and wishes that we can no longer pick out the priorities .
That is a very great pity because then it cannot be seen just where Parliament 's main criticisms of this action programme lie .
Madam President , the Commission 's action programme is so general and comprehensive that there is little in it with which I can disagree .
That is the strength , but also the weakness , of this document .
Too many general statements with very little commitment and too few specific priorities .
Admittedly the problems of transport are complex and very diverse .
In all fields of policy numerous legitimate aspirations need to be expressed , but that must not prevent priority choices being made or some parameters being drawn .
The Parodi report rightly mentions this .
So after the pan-European transport conference in Helsinki next year the Commission will have to draw up a new action programme and lay down clearer priorities .
In that connection I should like to point out three areas for attention .
In the first place the enlargement of the Union which will result. we expect , in a great increase in traffic .
The Union must address itself to that as a priority in collaboration with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
Secondly , with a view to the enlargement and because of the increasing traffic within the Union itself , the proportion of transport by rail and water must be considerably increased .
Inland navigation , coast-wise trade and rail will have to acquire a much stronger market position .
Measures for discouraging goods and passenger transport by road including the charging of external costs are insufficient where there is no good alternative .
Opening up the railway market and continuing construction of the trans-European networks are therefore necessary .
Thirdly , in view of the strong growth of air transport the Union will have to do its best to arrange taxation of aircraft fuel on a world scale .
Finally Mr Parodi is to be congratulated on the extensive piece of work he has put before us .
I am afraid , however , that there is a risk that sight will again be lost of the priorities since the report is so extensive and so complete .
Madam President , in its communication on the Common Transport Policy Action Programme for 1995-2000 the Commission has certainly heralded a step towards a comprehensive transport policy strategy .
The concentration on four lines of action is indicative of the desire to take an integrated approach to transport legislation .
What makes this all the more gratifying is that Members who serve on the competent parliamentary committee sometimes feel they are dealing with a motley assortment of unconnected legislative bills .
Transport , and this can never be repeated too often , cannot be compartmentalized into separate modes .
It must always be seen in its entirety and subordinated to overriding strategic aims , such as the reduction of environmental pollution .
These remarks assume particular significance if we look at the social dimension and the question of working hours .
Each of us knows that compliance with legally prescribed driving and rest periods is patchy .
This not only harms and endangers the drivers in question but also involves constant subsidization of an environmentally detrimental form of transport .
The legal remedies available to us at European level appear modest when compared with the powers available under classic competition law and with those vested in DirectorateGeneral VI .
The communication from the Commission envisages the line of action entitled ' taking account of the social dimension ' as amounting only to continued consultation of management and labour .
However , to rebuke the Commissioner for such inadequacies is to miss the point , for the real problem is that the Member States are continuing to hide behind the mask of subsidiarity .
But the consequences of this policy - or , to be more precise , this lack of policy - affect the whole internal market and distort competition between modes of transport .
And so in conclusion I wish to voice my doubts as to whether the Commission can ever achieve the aim it has formulated in the White Paper by environmentally compatible means .
Madam President , in many respects the report which we are currently debating is a positive document which takes the offensive .
We also therefore have reason to be thankful to the rapporteur , Mr Parodi , for the work he has done .
One major challenge still faces us , however , and that is to find an appropriate way of combining increased traffic with a better environment .
The UN has declared today World Environment Day .
This debate and the decision we are about to take should reflect this fact .
The environment is the biggest issue facing mankind as we approach the next millennium .
Nothing can be more important for us than to solve the environment 's various problems .
Road transport is indisputably to blame for many of the different problems affecting the environment .
In several countries the only effect this is having is to ensure that nobody can afford to buy new , more environmentally friendly cars .
As a result the cars in circulation are simply getting older and older as time goes by - and from the environmental point of view , worse and worse .
This is nevertheless the policy we are pursuing in a great many countries today .
This assumes that we have the courage to establish the objective and formulate the requirement that in the future cars will be powered by something other than today 's internal combustion engine .
What we really need today is to direct all action towards a time when the problems will have been solved .
If we allow the European motor industry to gear itself to this and also make available the necessary resources for research , I am convinced that this will work .
It would , Madam President , be one of the best investments we could make for the next generation .
It should also be mentioned in this context that it is absolutely essential to secure pan-European funding as soon as possible for the Brenner tunnel and its feeder lines .
The three participating countries - Austria , Germany and Italy - cannot raise this money alone .
The stoicism of the people living in this part of the Alps has limits that must not go on being transgressed indefinitely .
The realization of the Brenner tunnel project in particular will not only mean economic and ecological progress for the directly affected regions but will be of enormous benefit to the entire Union .
Madam President , I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on a fine report .
Good infrastructure within the European Union is important and air and sea links are imperative .
In Northern Ireland we totally depend on the links from our ports to the mainland of the United Kingdom .
All our imports and our exports depend on an efficient roll-on , roll-off infrastructure .
Sea transport is our road and bridge to mainland United Kingdom and further to mainland continental Europe .
I welcome the inclusion of seat-belts because this is a very necessary safety measure for buses and coaches within the European Union .
When we speak of harmonisation of fuel and vehicle taxes , I have some concern .
I believe we must have a level playing field but we must harmonise at a realistic level .
Flags of convenience in our shipping industry have haunted us for years and we have never achieved a solution .
This is a very serious problem and it will not disappear .
We have not been prepared to date to face up to the consequences of increased safety on our sea routes .
Finally , I welcome the fact that Mr Van Miert is the Commissioner here this evening .
Many years ago , when he had the responsibility for transport , I led a deputation of Westminster MPs to see him .
When we arrived at his office it was found that Northern Ireland did not even exist .
There were no links from Northern Ireland to mainland United Kingdom and Europe .
I would like to play tribute to him tonight because after our visit to him , he ensured that we had links from Belfast and Larne and the other ports .
The report , then , contains a wealth of useful suggestions and constructive criticisms which the Commission will naturally take into account in its deliberations .
I must of course point out that not all objectives can be realized in the short term and that the development of the Community transport policy is a long-term operation .
Inevitably it is impossible within the compass of this short debate here to go into each separate suggestion , observation or criticism in Mr Parodi 's report .
As you know , that was the period for which I still had some responsibility .
In setting up the action programme the Commission 's intention is simply to present a number of possible actions .
The parameters for the policy and strategy were in fact already laid down in the white paper .
It is true that the main areas of our activity are sketched out in greater detail in the action programme for the sake of clarity .
I have noticed that too in most meetings ; actually we are not so far apart .
It is more a matter of appreciation , of emphasis .
It seems to us impossible to discuss further in the framework of this debate all questions noted in the report .
I should like to refer to various points made , but unfortunately we do not have the time .
So I shall be very brief , but there are individual points which must be mentioned .
We must also try to be practical and to move ahead .
The report also repeats the idea , long held within Parliament , that our general policy and our specific proposals must be based on a better statistical foundation .
Naturally we agree , but you know how hard it is to get reliable material from the various Member States .
In some sectors the position is better .
I am thinking amongst other things of sea and air transport , and as that material becomes available it will naturally be used by the Commission .
Then I should like to make an observation or a reflection with regard to various critical asides on the social and employment aspects of transport policy .
But unfortunately we have had to recognize that on that plane too the willingness of the Council of Ministers and a number of governments was minimal .
May I remind you that years ago the Commission took the initiative of trying to harmonize flying time and rest time for pilots , but we came back empty-handed .
Then I should like to touch on what Mr Lüttge said and I should like to sing his praises to some extent because he is one of the foremost originators of pan-European thinking at this time .
But unfortunately that too is a long time ago .
We should have been able to do a great deal more if only we had had the necessary budgetary resources put at our disposal to support specific projects .
But we must keep hammering away at it .
Naturally the position is the same with the trans-European networks .
Here I assume that no-one in this Parliament can reproach the Commission with not making the necessary efforts .
Here too moreover I should like to sing Parliament 's praises .
That was how we received our first funds .
Parliament together with the Commission have always had to fight the Council to get the money needed .
With the prospect of the summit meeting of the European Council at Florence you know how hard the Commission and its President in particular will be hammering that point home again .
I can only express the hope that mad cow disease will not put a spoke in the wheel again to delay the matter for us once again .
I should like to conclude with that , ladies and gentlemen .
Certainly there would be other things to say , but I think I can leave it at that .
I should like to thank all those who have spoken for their contribution , and once more , on behalf of Neil Kinnock , I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
( The sitting was suspended at 8.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
Driving licences
Mr President , this directive can be summarized in a few words .
At first reading , the European Parliament approved the Commission proposal of 16 January 1995 on the alternative plastic credit card model driving licence , making eight amendments .
They were important amendments , and I shall mention only the most important three .
The scheduled date of entry into force of the directive remains 1 July 1996 .
In substance , the Council has accepted three of the European Parliament 's eight first reading amendments .
The rapporteur is therefore proposing not only to retable some of the amendments from the first reading , but also to alter some passages where the Council has changed the initial proposal .
Amendment No 3 merely slims down the Council 's proposal by removing the first part .
The fact is , people already pay for the licence , pay road tax , pay a pile of other taxes , and in my view they should not have to pay another annual tax as well .
The licence card is actually intended to facilitate the free movement of European citizens and to promote the mutual recognition of driving licences .
But after examining the Council 's common position , I cannot help thinking that the Council wants to take systematic action to prevent any progress towards a stronger common identity within the European Union .
Almost every article contains one of the words optional and non-compulsory .
These words , though quite innocuous in themselves , nevertheless mean that it is being left to the discretion of each Member State to do what it wants when it wants .
The common position is indeed a prime example of the Council 's inability to arrive at proper joint decisions .
Only when it comes to disregarding the proposals of Parliament does the Council seem able to draw on vast reserves of solidarity .
The basis of the proposal for the credit-card model , however , was the potential controlled use of future information technology .
I wonder how mutual recognition is meant to work in Europe on this basis .
The problem must be resolved , even if we have to wait until an action for discrimination is brought before the European Court of Justice .
I take the view that the term ' European driving licence ' is a case of fraudulent misrepresentation .
The Committee on Transport and Tourism has adopted four amendments for the second reading .
My group will support them .
The directive , as we know , is due to enter into force on the first of July this year .
Its stated intention is to wait until the plastic card is introduced .
Secondly , it facilitates any spot-checks that may be necessary and thereby enhances road safety .
Thirdly , it guarantees greater flexibility of use while reducing the risk of licence forgery .
I should like to congratulate the Council on its decision to side with Parliament in opposing the Commission proposal to limit the validity of the licence to ten years .
This decision gives user states the chance to decide themselves on the term of validity of the driving licence , which , though drawn up in accordance with the EU model , is still a national licence .
At the same time , the Group of the European People 's Party not only favours a far longer term but actually supports unlimited validity .
This would help to save money and to minimize bureaucracy .
The introduction of a separate space in which the issuing country may make optional entries is in line with the wishes of Parliament .
The option of including bar codes and national symbols - which , of course , must not impair comprehensibility and mutual recognition - accords with the legitimate interests of the Member States .
Let us hope that this also contributes to speedy implementation .
I propose that we support Mr Farassino and his report .
Mr President , we have to be strict about not allowing Member States to collect tax on driving licences annually .
I also support Mr Farassino in urging that a reference to the flexible use of driving licences and to the prevention of forgery should be included in the directive .
It would also be sensible to include information on the driving licence about consent for organ donation .
I failed completely to understand why a centralized monitoring system in the form of a register of penalty points should be introduced in connection with driving licences .
Restricting the duration of licences to ten years would also increase bureaucracy unnecessarily .
The requirement laid down in the directive that lorry drivers who wear glasses should lose their licence after 1 July has caused great amazement among the Finns .
The wearing of glasses or contact lenses with a strength of + / -4 does not in any way hinder their driving .
There are proportionally more long-sighted people working as professional drivers than in any other profession .
I would like to ask the Commissioner how this error will be rectified .
Parliament will have to request immediate negotiations between the bodies concerned in order to correct the directive in this respect .
This proposal from the Commission , with the sensible amendments from the rapporteur , will take the harmonisation process forward by requiring a common code system for conditions under which any driver is authorised to use a vehicle .
In the European Union we have already had mutual recognition of driving licences for some time now .
But that has not meant that every police officer in every Member State inspecting those licences fully understands what is communicated or written on them .
The new licences will make certain that police officers will be able in the future to appreciate and understand the information contained in them .
The driving licences are certainly going to be of value to road safety .
They will certainly enhance the feeling of the right of movement by EU citizens and they will also certainly benefit disabled drivers .
The licence also contains a micro-chip and it is this that has caused the greatest debate among the Members .
I can understand and appreciate the fear that might be felt among certain people that this card would develop into an ID card , via the back door .
To offset that danger , the rapporteur and the Commission have agreed to a special committee , which will examine the confidentiality and security implications of the micro-chip .
In the meantime , I certainly welcome the rapporteur 's report with the hope that the Commission will give that report their full support .
I also look forward to more people , even from the island of the United Kingdom who have the habit of driving on the wrong side of the road , driving even further on the continent of Europe .
So let us regard this proposal as a first step in the right direction , though not perhaps the last .
But driving licences are also part of our citizens ' everyday lives .
It does seem to me , however , that the most important of the amendments is the fourth , the aim of which is to outlaw the imposition of annual taxes on driving licences .
The beneficial effect of the introduction of a European driving licence would , in my opinion , be completely overshadowed by these disadvantages .
That is why we also support Mr Farassino 's proposal , and we hope that he will obtain a majority here in the House for all his amendments .
Mr President , despite the unresolved issues , I believe that we can generally be satisfied with the work done on this Directive .
The Commission , with its credit-card model , has put forward a foresighted proposal .
It represents a successful compromise between harmonization and respect for the specific characteristics of our Member States .
Every citizen of the EU who lives for more than three months in another Member State will come to appreciate the advantages offered by this Directive .
And from a parliamentary point of view , we too can take pleasure in the fact that some of the results of our work are reflected in the common position .
Licence-holders who so wish , for example , will now be able to have their blood group and allergies entered on request and make a voluntary undertaking to donate organs .
Anyone who remembers the first reading here in the House will know that even this dictate of common sense did not pass unchallenged by some Members .
Mr President , let us begin by heartily congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Farassino , on his report .
Naturally it is not the first time this matter has been discussed here in Parliament , but we are in fact close to taking a further step in the right direction .
I am glad to note that in the Council 's common position Parliament 's amendments adopted in first reading and accepted and approved by the Commission at the time have been included .
As honourable Members are aware , special space is to be reserved on the card with a view to the possible introduction in the future of a microchip or similar computer device .
The Commission intends to set up a working group to study this question and in the light of its conclusions we shall consider whether or not to make a formal proposal .
I hope that as a result the disquiet expressed amongst other things by many Members at first reading will be allayed .
Another contentious point in the discussion was the length of validity of the card , which the Commission had proposed as ten years .
Like a small majority in Parliament I regret that the Council has unanimously removed that provision .
But I thank Parliament for giving the Commission its support at first reading .
Three of the four amendments proposed by the Committee on Transport are identical to those already made at first reading , when the Commission said that it could not accept them .
The Commission also explained the reasons on that occasion and I am quite ready to do that again briefly .
A Member State will in any case have to be mentioned since the initial for the country must be printed on one side of the card .
Amendment No 3 aims at deleting the words ' European Communities model ' on the licence .
However , the position is that mutual recognition of driving licences is ensured by those words . For that reason we cannot accept that amendment either .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
Inland waterway transport
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a Council Regulation on my report relates to the free provision of services in the transport of goods or passengers .
The intention is to create a legal guarantee of free access by transport undertakings in the Community Member States to inland waterway transport .
The Commission considers that , since Austria joined the Union , a new arrangement is required .
This is because Austria has concluded bilateral agreements with Germany and the Netherlands .
They make access to the international inland waterway transport market more difficult for carriers in that sector who are based in other Member States .
These bilateral agreements are therefore incompatible with the principle of the free provision of services .
Not only that , but they imply a discrimination based on nationality .
Austria 's membership of the European Union thus offers an opportunity to do so .
The initial Commission proposal was adopted unamended by Parliament on first reading .
I fully endorse this proposal .
This proposal has therefore been adopted unanimously by the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the second reading .
It is therefore this report , which poses no particular difficulties , that I have the honour of presenting today to be voted upon in this House .
And , once again , I thank the rapporteur and Parliament for their solid support .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
Green Paper on innovation
Nor should it become a form of hidden state aid for sectors that cannot effectively compete in such markets .
The innovation process is more complicated than that , and we in the European Union should ask ourselves whether the existing research and development policies and structures are based on an up-to-date understanding of the subject .
In that context , three routes of action in the Commission 's proposal deserve special mention .
This route of action must include more industrial research laboratories in its fourth activity .
Rather , it is a matter for private investors and for the companies themselves , which are impeded by the prudence of institutional investors , the structure of tax systems and their own lack of technical expertise .
Yet the investment structure with regard to the fostering of innovation in the European Union is so underdeveloped that the subject is an important public policy issue .
Without things of that sort I think that the Union will fail in its activities .
I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Argyros on this excellent report and the work he has put into it .
It is a credit to this House .
Millions of years ago the dinosaurs died out because they could not adapt fast enough to a changing world .
Today the same fate faces European industry if we cannot make change our ally .
Innovation is the lifeblood of the new global economy and our only hope for survival in a hostile economic environment .
But the picture painted by the European Commission is none too bright .
The picture is made bleaker still by the attitude of Member States such as my own where innovation is sacrificed on the altar of short-termism .
A lack of long-term planning and an obsession with dividend payouts to shareholders mean that innovation is left a long way down the list of priorities .
Europe 's role in curing this disease is strictly limited but that is why we have to make sure that what we do , we do well .
Above all , we have to bridge the gulf between business and science , not only in terms of disseminating information but in building a working partnership between innovators and industry .
The two are not chalk and cheese .
They should be flip sides of the same coin .
Making this a reality begins at the most basic level .
These are the foundations for an innovation-based society and industry .
The Commission 's proposals and the recommendations in this report could kick-start this process .
In particular , through the creation of a sectoral taskforce , they provide a basis for bringing science and industry together in a goal-driven team .
They also mark a move away from the old subsidy-based approach .
Our task must be to make sure that the Member States show equal determination to fulfil their part of the bargain .
Action in Europe is no excuse for complacency at home .
I shall restrict myself to the social issues .
The relationship between society and innovation is a symbiotic one .
On the one hand , the way a society is organised plays a major role in determining whether innovations come into being at all .
On the other , innovations can in themselves change society . This is the way it has always been .
They can also play a significant role in the future too .
I am often asked whether innovation will create new jobs .
I usually answer that it depends on whether one takes the short-term or the long-term view , whether one sees the issue in its narrowest sense or more broadly .
Narrowly speaking , and in the short term , innovation in a limited field can of course result in fewer jobs .
However , history shows that societies which have been open to innovation have always been the most competitive societies , societies which have been able to carry on and create new jobs .
I am therefore convinced that a society which favours innovation also creates jobs .
Finally , a word about business and employees . It is sometimes said that employees and co-determination for employees are a burden on industry .
Where innovation is concerned this is definitely not the case .
In companies where employees have considerable influence and co-determination is important it is much easier to foster attitudes which are favourable to the implementation of innovations .
This is why co-determination and employee participation is incredibly important in a society which seeks to be innovative .
Mr President , we have to face the fact that the Community 's competitive position in relation to Japan and the United States is going backwards and not forwards .
We must also face the fact that the evidence is clear that it is not a failure in research which is the problem but the failure to apply the research to products and processes .
This is not an assessment which is new to us on the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy .
In fact , as we know , within the current fourth programme innovation is a fully-fledged programme in its own right .
The Commission 's Green Paper is a welcome document .
It recognizes the need for some new thinking to encourage the innovation processes .
Proposals for action at Community level are now awaited from the consultation process which the Green Paper has initiated .
The rapporteur subsequently went to the bother of tightening up the resolution to make it much more focused and that was unanimously approved by our committee .
Because of this the Socialist Group fully agrees with the resolution and we will vote against any amendments .
Over the years Community research has created a great reservoir of ideas .
The task now is to ensure that this knowledge reaches every manufacturing and service business .
Production processes and services activities have to be broken down into their components and analysed for methods of improvement .
That is the culture we have to encourage .
It is truly a formidable challenge to the concept of the information society .
Actions at Community level will be useless unless there is a strong link with regional and local technology and innovation centres .
Member States have a key responsibility to promote these centres and , where appropriate , the structural and cohesion funds of the Community should be used in support .
The big idea concept will not solve our problems .
A multitude of small applications probably will .
This problem is currently the main concern of the European Union .
Jobs will only ever be secure if we establish ourselves in a leading position in the technologies of tomorrow .
In this respect , I believe that three particularly important points are made in the Green Paper .
First of all , there is the dissemination and exploitation of research results .
In addition , it is naturally essential that research findings should be presented in an informative and intelligible manner to the general public and that a technology culture should be promoted .
At the same time , I am aware that these two efforts cannot be centrally directed but must come from below , so to speak , beginning in school .
Secondly , in the European Union we have 15 research policies , many of which are formulated in isolation .
If our innovative capacity is to be enhanced , closer cooperation at national and Union levels is necessary .
This necessary competition is not simply a matter of duplicated effort at twice the cost but also releases creativity and ideas for the future , and they are just what we need !
I recognize the potential of this approach and I am sure we will continue the debate and exchange of views with Commissioner Cresson when it comes to refinancing the Fourth Framework Programme .
For the moment , we approve and encourage the Commission 's efforts in the Green Paper .
That has resulted in a brief , cohesive resolution .
The most important message of the green paper is that the Commission , like a number of Member States , is extending technological policy into innovation policy .
In itself it is a readable document with a good analysis and lines of action which seem likely to be effective .
The headpiece put on it with the task force is rather incomprehensible to the Liberal Group .
Close coordination of research efforts is necessary .
But that must not entail covert sector support .
For liberals that is something akin to swearing in church .
The development of generic technologies useful for many sectors can actually increase the competitive capacity of the whole European Union .
Secondly , the distribution of powers between national authorities and the European authority according to line of action is arguable .
Innovation policy including technology policy needs to be developed and implemented at national level unless the extent of the problem or of the scale is of such a nature as to require an approach at European level .
Innovation policy for the small and medium-sized businesses seems to be pre-eminently a task for the national authorities .
Besides , small- and medium-sized businesses are not a homogeneous group of undertakings but an extremely diverse group .
A different approach according to the target group is desirable .
So I am glad that my amendment on that has been taken up .
From various enquiries it seems that with small- and medium-sized businesses one working year 's research and development provides twice as many innovations as in big business .
But the number of innovations successfully introduced on to the market is pitifully small .
The percentage of success for Europe as a whole is only 20 % .
That is primarily due to strong selectivity on the technological sides of innovation and insufficient attention to market aspects .
My Group hopes that a fundamentally different approach to the problems of innovation will lead to a new and effective policy with , as its aim , wide scope for innovative firms and new opportunities for employment .
Innovations obviously have a positive impact in many ways , but not necessarily a positive social impact .
Innovations can help to create new jobs and entire industries , but the opposite can also be the case .
Research into the social impact of innovations should therefore form a part of innovation policy .
An increase in production efficiency as a result of innovations should also be beneficial to employees , for example by leading to shorter working hours and a redistribution of tasks .
Finally , I should like to emphasize that the innovation policy presented by the Commission focuses too much on technology .
Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking Mr Argyros for a very good report , which I largely support .
I have nevertheless tabled three amendments , as I believe there are a number of things Mr Argyros has forgotten .
My first amendment concerns environmental taxes .
The Union should not risk falling behind on these important issues because of a fear of innovation and change .
It is also absolutely essential that risk capital should be made available for innovators .
I propose that the NASDAQ model should be used to achieve this .
My final amendment is aimed at the inclusion of young people too in a European network , whereas the committee today only proposes women .
Thank you .
For one thing , I advocate more vigorous support of the Scientific and Technological Option Assessment unit ( STOA ) .
I regard this as an absolutely essential point , because technology assessment helps to broaden the range of instruments available for technological forecasting .
STOA should cooperate closely with the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies ( IPTS ) , and the IPTS should be assigned a key role in improving the coordination of European technology assessments .
One of the main aspects of innovation is the question of security and access to information .
At the Euratom Conference on the Control of Nuclear Material in Novosibirsk , which I attended yesterday , it became clear how important innovation is in the domain of control .
It is also important to be aware of the need to promote initial and advanced training in this domain .
Innovation in the field of human resources must take place through the development of the existing programmes , such as Socrates , Leonardo and TACIS .
I also call on the Commission to create a European network of women self-starters .
We are undergoing a comprehensive structural transformation from industrial society to service and information society .
The service sector is a women 's domain .
The number of women who have started businesses has increased considerably .
The most important enabling measure for women self-starters is state-aided professional consultancy .
A special coaching model would be highly desirable , in other words advice provided over a lengthy period by a consultant for particularly innovative self-starters , be they men or women .
Consideration should be given to the establishment of intersectoral , supraregional and European coordinating agencies for business start-ups .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to pay tribute to Mr Argyros for the quality of his report .
This report comes at the end of the consultation period which has provided an opportunity to an unprecedented debate on innovation throughout the European Union .
I should like to comment on the main suggestions contained in Parliament 's motion for a resolution . First , the dissemination and exploitation of research and technical development results .
Parliament calls for more support for the Innovation and Mobility programme , and suggests the creation of a Dissemination and Exploitation Task Force .
I thank Parliament for this support for programmes which the Commission proposes to reinforce in the fifth framework programme .
Parliament wants there to be greater awareness of the ' Innovation ' process , with the preparation of innovation indicators and a rolling review of best national practices in the encouragement of innovation .
The debate centred on the Green Paper has highlighted the need for deeper knowledge of innovation and the present shortcomings in this area .
The Commission will in future be preparing a regular report on innovation in Europe and on the policies that support it , drawing on completely reliable indicators .
Parliament recommends improving the orientation of research .
I shall come back in due course to certain observations in this chapter , especially those regarding the social aspects of innovation and the task forces .
The fourth concern expressed in this chapter is support for the various forms of cooperation between the innovation actors .
Collaboration between complementary professions and occupations , which is one of the basic mechanisms of innovation , will have to be reinforced in the fifth Framework Programme .
Parliament expresses a wish for improved cooperation and coordination between national and Community research policies .
As you know , I fully share this concern .
At the time of my inaugural address , I clearly stated to you my intention of using every opportunity afforded by the Treaty in this area .
First , encouraging investment in risk capital and equity , especially for the high-growth innovative undertakings which represent an important source of new job creation . Secondly , supporting the development of high-liquidity transeuropean capital markets for innovative undertakings .
The Commission departments , together with the European Investment Fund , are exploring ways of steering the latter 's instruments towards innovation .
I also consider it essential not to underestimate the potential represented by large undertakings in the field of research and innovation .
Among the many recommendations and new ideas that it presents , the report expresses the desire that consideration should be given to means of steering the structural funds to innovation .
Training becomes a necessity that lasts all one 's life .
Regarding the idea of a register of new qualifications created by innovation , I can tell you that I shall take due note of it .
I now come to the subject of the task forces . This is a subject which was extensively debated on the occasion of the review of the proposal to extend the fourth Framework Programme .
That debate enabled the situation to be clarified .
I believe , in particular , that the two objectives aimed at by the creation of this instrument have been identified .
And secondly by stimulating , as Mr Argyros 's report emphasizes , cooperation in these fields at European and national level .
Nevertheless , I do of course recognize the importance of the information society and the promise held out by biotechnology and environmental technologies .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
EURET programme
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Madam Commissioner , the EURET programme is the first specific programme for research and technological development in the field of transport .
It started off in 1991 under the second framework programme .
The transport sector is pre-eminently a sector requiring a European approach .
Research on and the introduction of new techniques and technologies are of decisive importance for solving the European transport problem .
The start of European research in this field in 1991 must therefore at least be referred to as late .
So it is no wonder that there is no European vision in the direction of R & D in the field of transport by land , sea or air .
The report before us today is an evaluation of the EURET programme prepared by a panel of five independent specialists .
It therefore lacks depth . The experts say so themselves .
Every Member of this Parliament has the right according to the Treaty of Rome to work in his or her own language .
Nevertheless that right is regularly trampled under foot by the Commission .
This question plays a part at Council level also , because yesterday the Netherlands ministers announced that they would take decisions exclusively on the basis of documents translated into good Dutch and ready in good time .
The way in which the evaluation of the EURET programme has been approached is not acceptable to your rapporteur .
It would have been possible to start with the evaluation before all projects had been wholly completed .
It is true that an interim report was made in 1993 but even that report came out a year later than had been envisaged .
It referred to all the gaps in the control and management structure of the projects .
Nevertheless there was no adjustment .
The final report on the EURET programme was drawn up only after the specific transport programme in the fourth framework programme had been approved .
The final evaluation of EURET thus failed in its mission .
It made no contribution to the fourth framework programme .
The Committee on Research therefore hopes that the experts ' recommendations will at least be used in the implementation of the specific programme and in the drafting of the fifth framework programme .
The 1995 external monitoring report also calls on the Commission for a more specific vision in the field of transport .
Cohesion between the programme 's various areas of research and collaboration with other DGs in this field is essential .
Overlapping must be avoided .
Sustainable mobility can be achieved only if the proper strategies are developed .
The fourth framework programme is directed particularly to transport efficiency and only marginally to prevention and changes in modal distribution .
Tele-working therefore needs to be encouraged throughout Europe because that is a specific technological application which may reduce mobility .
A further aim of many Member States is to reduce environmental pollution such as the emission of various harmful substances , by means of energy efficiency .
Research can make an important contribution to the development of environment-friendly technology in the transport sector .
For that too a European vision with a planned approach would not be out of place .
Clean engines which use considerably less energy and therefore burn more cleanly would make the car more acceptable as a means of transport .
For that a European directive on maximum emissions is needed .
In 1994 when the period envisaged had expired , a further ECU 8 million was spent on extra appropriations in order to ensure that a number of projects within EURET were continued .
And what was the percentage contributed by Member States to these projects ?
The positive obverse side of European research lies in innovation .
But the reverse side of the coin is the project which we are discussing at the moment on the evaluation of a series of programmes related to transport .
Experience in this respect has been problematical but the research which is at present under way and which is due to continue , is very important .
Transport is increasingly one more structural variable on top of so many other social , economic and all sorts of other variables .
It has not been possible for the recommendations of the group of experts to be incorporated in the fourth framework programme , and that is really serious .
That is to say , a series of factors of enormous importance .
I hope there will be no repetition of this and that studies on transport will nevertheless continue to be an important feature of subjects for research .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make it clear that I am replying here on behalf of Mr Neil Kinnock , who is currently travelling on official business .
The Euret programme has replaced the Union 's original research programme in the transport sector .
That was a trial .
To judge by the general tenor of the evaluation report by the independent experts , that trial has been considered conclusive .
I welcome that .
Rather than considering them all one by one , I would like to comment briefly on some of them .
That is only partially true .
The first period for submitting proposals for the new programme in fact ended on 15 March 1995 .
Some of the recommendations made by the experts were thus able to be taken into consideration .
Overall , however , the Commission shares the feeling that the evaluation report on Euret was not available at the time when it would have been most useful .
Nor was it the only one to be in that situation , because of the provisions adopted in the third Framework Programme .
This situation was rectified with the fourth Framework Programme .
In the adoption decision , it is clearly stipulated that the evaluation reports must be available and disclosed to the European Parliament before the Commission presents its proposal for the fifth Framework Programme .
The question of the coordination and complementarity of the European and national efforts , mentioned in sections 5 and 6 , also has to be considered in a qualified manner .
A minimum of coordination was guaranteed , as is always the case , through the agency of the programme committee .
Here again , especially , I can reassure you .
In the follow-up to the Commission communication , ' Achieving coordination through cooperation ' , the CREST had its coordinating mandate strengthened .
Ad hoc groups , broadly supporting programme committees , were set up .
They were intended to make it possible to ensure good coordination and optimum complementarity between national and European activities .
As to the problem of administrative expenditure , mentioned in section 13 of the motion for a resolution , it must be considered in the light of all the different aspects .
Of course this figure is higher than the average , too high , and in future we will need to ensure that expenditure in this category does not rise to such a level .
But the programme was a small-scale one and , as you know , there are fixed costs that cannot be reduced .
It is more difficult , therefore , to keep the administrative costs of smaller programmes at the ideal level .
Above all , this was a first programme , so that this expenditure can be regarded as investment outlay .
Thanks to this above-average effort , the administrative costs of the ' Transport ' programme amounted to only 4.9 % of the total committed credits .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
Cooperation in research and technological development
The aim is to define , for the first time , the principles of a strategy for scientific and technical cooperation between the European Union and the rest of the world .
This attempt had never been made before .
Contacts were made haphazardly , as it were , between the European Union , especially the Commission , and its Permanent Representations in third countries .
There was no defined strategy .
In fact , I could ask no better proof of this than the confusion - the unacceptable confusion - that exists in the Commission 's report between scientific cooperation as such and technological cooperation .
And , as in the Commission report , which might have been discarded if Parliament had not been there , the projects are not identified .
And it is nevertheless necessary to maintain and recognize those fields of excellence that are specific and particular to the European Union .
We can wave our arms around as much as we like , we shall achieve nothing .
This approach calls for a number of task forces , which have been defined .
This can provide a basis for defining a genuine policy of cooperation with third countries , designed to bring to the fore a Europe of competences .
As regards the last amendment put forward by Mr Holm , I have to confess that I do not understand it .
It seems to me that he is firing at his own side , since research into the elimination of fissile materials will in fact lead to dangers of proliferation .
A breakdown on the basis of policy objectives ought to be considered for the Fifth Framework Programme .
That is the thrust of the three amendments proposed by the Committee on External Economic Relations to strengthen Mr Pompidou 's text further , and I congratulate him again on an excellent report .
His contribution helped us to identify the needs of the developing countries .
Some of the areas of specific interest that have to be addressed include food supply , health and environmental protection and energy issues .
Food security and the health sector represent the main priority .
A global emergency has been declared by the World Health Organisation on tuberculosis , which has killed millions of people in recent years .
Famines which were relatively rare in Africa in the 1960s , re-emerged as endemic in the 1980s and 1990s .
According to the Food and Agricultural Organisation , 44 out of 52 African countries are presently threatened by severe food shortages .
Devoting resources to getting more food to a given area is therefore of high priority .
A few guidelines should be essential to our cooperation with the developing countries , if we are to implement a research policy that truly serves development needs .
The Development Committee was very happy to commend this report , as do I here tonight .
For many years , indeed , we have seen the economic structure , the financial system and even environmental hazards assuming global dimensions .
It is not only astronauts who see the world as a single entity .
The world itself is developing an increasing number of common visions .
But the coordination of many activities into one global action must not blind us to the fact that continental , national and regional conflicts are on the increase .
Some of them , as you know , are discussed here in the House too .
The Cold War may be over , but real wars , conflicts between groups , regions and states , have not subsided .
In addition , we are increasingly conscious of differing attitudes on to ethics , tolerance and human rights , as well as to environmental matters and technological safety .
These have become more visible , especially against the background of global competition .
We shall be supporting the resolutions tabled by the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy .
Cooperation and the exchange of knowledge in research and technological development are a sine qua non for research workers .
They presuppose , of course , adherence to basic principles , and especially the protection of intellectual and industrial property .
These agreements must promote the exchange of knowledge , via the use , especially , of global information technology networks .
Mr President , I should like to begin by complimenting Mr Pompidou on his report and in particular the distinction he draws between scientific cooperation and technological development is excellent .
Universities have been cooperating on scientific matters for a long time past .
Even before there was any mention of an information society the universities already had EUARN ( European Academic Research Network ) .
New advanced applications often come from the academic world , where there is good collaboration in the field of information technology .
Now all European national research networks , associated in DANTE , have applied for a project TEN 34 which aims at linking all these networks by means of 34 megabyte optical fibre cables .
It will be possible to carry out experiments and to develop European standards which we are so looking forward to .
So it is incomprehensible for the Liberal Group that this project , which can really help us in the competition stakes has already been blocked by DG III and DG XIII in the Commission for a year past .
I hope that in the future the Commission too will learn to cooperate so that international cooperation will be possible in the academic world also .
Mr President , as a number of speakers have already stated , it is a very important and good report that Mr Pompidou has produced .
I tabled several amendments in committee which Mr Pompidou and the committee endorsed .
However , there is still one thing on which Mr Pompidou and I do not agree , and that is my amendment concerning plutonium .
What we want to see is not the proliferation of plutonium , of course , but global cooperation to resolve the problem of plutonium and other fissionable material .
In the Union alone there are today 340 tonnes of plutonium , which makes the resolution of this issue of the utmost importance .
This can be done in cooperation with other countries which unfortunately also , like those in the Union , have large quantities of plutonium .
Plutonium is dangerous and this is an issue which affects me as a young person a great deal because I know that something could happen involving it .
International cooperation on this subject is therefore of the utmost importance .
Thank you very much .
Mr President , the two reports we have dealt with this evening - the Argyros report and the Pompidou report - are very closely interrelated .
That is also demonstrated by the almost identical lists of speakers .
As this debate draws to its close I really wish to confine myself to a very few remarks .
The devil , however , is so much in the detail here as in the implementation .
For example , we are going to need clear statements on codetermination and on the possible cofinancing of research projects by third countries .
There must also be decisions regarding the right to use the results of such research and regarding entitlement to subsequent profits .
That brings us to the question of intellectual property .
The absence of harmonized rules governing intellectual property is not unique to Europe .
We shall also have to incorporate the national rules that already exist , of course , into international agreements .
We shall have to guarantee compatibility .
But we also need compatibility between all the factors associated with venture capital and with mixed public / private funding .
A great deal has been said today about all these points .
Such harmonization will serve us well when it comes to cooperating at international level .
Parliament has always shown a special interest in this question , and has undertaken various initiatives in this field .
This report and this motion for a resolution are a logical continuation of those efforts .
Overall , then , the Commission can only express its agreement .
Without going into detail about the very numerous articles contained in the resolution , I would like to make a few brief comments on three points .
The resolution calls on the Commission to specify the arrangements for cooperation , by distinguishing between the various types of collaboration and the major categories of countries .
I can tell you that a seminar on international scientific and technological cooperation , attended by representatives of all these bodies and of the Commission , will be held during the second half of this year .
Finally , the resolution rightly emphasizes the need for closer cooperation between the activities of the Union and those of its Member States in this field .
Work on this question has begun .
The hope is that it will shortly result in the establishment of an initial basis for improved coordination , and I shall be sure to keep you informed of the developments that occur in this field .
The Commission intends this importance to be clearly reflected in its future actions .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
Financial instrument for the environment ( LIFE )
Mr President , in Italy the name LIFE is currently being used by a group of secessionist tax refusers , so its reputation is none too good .
To achieve this result , the LIFE rules need to be clarified , gaps filled in and obstacles eliminated .
That means that we must be very cautious in awarding these funds and ensure that the money is spent on useful projects .
In the past there have been repeated complaints of a lack of transparency in the awarding of funds .
The main root of the problem has been that no precise criteria for the selection of projects were laid down in the original LIFE programme .
So the primary objective of the revised LIFE proposal under discussion today is to establish such criteria .
Today 's text considerably improves the catalogue of elimination and evaluation criteria for LIFE applications .
On behalf of my group I very much welcome that .
How the evaluation criteria work in practice remains to be seen and will have to be reviewed in due course .
Given the shortage of funds , that is something we simply cannot afford to do .
That is why I say that the best available technology must be used as the basis of evaluation when it comes to selecting projects for the further development of existing technology .
The common position on the Directive defines the term ' best available technology ' , which means that an agreed basis for the use of the term is already in place .
Some countries do need to catch up , and instead of being content to go on letting them lag behind we should ensure that their technology reflects the state of the art by providing them with the necessary funds .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is fair to point out that Community policy on the environment has been carried out ever more comprehensively and effectively .
The proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of a financial instrument for the environment - the LIFE programme - which we support , forms part of this policy .
I should like to believe that the Member States will take proper advantage of all the aid this regulation offers them .
Mr President , many thanks to Mrs Marinucci for her very good report that we have been discussing here .
' Environment ' , it seems , is but a word , an empty shell .
ECU 600 million had almost been voted by the Council .
A majority of the ministers were on the point of agreeing , when things suddenly took a turn for the worse .
Petty jealousies , concern that too much money might be poured into the South , finally won the day , and agreement was reached on ECU 450 million .
Does this amount really reflect the wishes of the European people ?
What is more , this amount of ECU 450 million has been earmarked for a multiannual programme .
This is downright scandalous , Mrs Bjerregaard !
The one is really no substitute for the other .
I should also like to mention the Commission 's laxity with regard to the investigation of the misuse of LIFE funds in Italy .
Why has it taken so long to institute proceedings ?
This reticence on the part of the Commission is losing us a great deal of money every year !
Lastly , I wanted to mention that the inclusion of the countries of central and eastern Europe is very important to us , because environmental conditions in some parts of those countries are disastrous .
But if that is mentioned as a priority , Commissioner , we must also be prepared to find the necessary resources .
Where will you obtain the money for such priorities ?
I am interested to hear that .
Mr President , we shall support Mrs Marinucci 's proposal for presenting these seven amendments again .
We should like to draw attention to two of them .
I could mention many : Doñana , las Tablas de Daimiel , Santoña and so on .
On the other hand Amendment No 5 proposes more funds .
The problem always lies in the scant resources allocated for dealing with a programme like Nature 2000 .
DG XI itself has sent us today a very interesting bulletin , no 1 , in which it is clearly shown how many countries there are which have still not started to designate their special areas for conservation .
This very week in my country , in the Island of Lanzarote , which is a biospheric reserve , military installations have led to the disappearance of a plant which is unique in the world .
The only place in which it lived was the Risco de Zamara in the Island of Lanzarote .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner .
LIFE has proved to be a successful environmental policy instrument , not least as far as Finland is concerned , judging by our experience of one year of membership .
The proposed budget of ECU 450 million for the entire second stage of LIFE is , however , totally insufficient , especially if the intention is to broaden the scope of the instrument .
As far as the share allocated to third world countries is concerned , where the problems are severe , the amount is really negligible , a mere five per cent .
The effectiveness of LIFE should be safeguarded .
In other words , efforts should be made to ensure that projects are implemented as planned , but monitoring problems should be solved other than by means of increased bureaucracy .
Projects should have genuine merit .
With respect to industrial projects , particular attention should be given to whether the project really is innovative .
They should promote the development and application of the most useful technology available .
A clean , viable environment is fundamental to the future of mankind .
We will not achieve real and lasting environmental improvements until such time as a sufficient number of people are aware of the real state of the environment and are willing to assume responsibility for it .
This is why I consider it very important that the results of these projects are communicated efficiently , so that the information can be circulated as widely as possible .
Mr President , first of all I should like to say that the Commission much appreciates Parliament 's speedy second reading of the Council 's common position .
I am happy to note that we are approaching the target in the best possible conditions .
It may be regarded as being the bright spot for the European environment and for the fruitful development which LIFE is trying to promote thanks to a creative strategy in which new methods and technologies are used .
Of course it is not a perfect compromise since the Council has not included some of the improvements which Parliament had proposed and which the Commission had accepted .
Amendment No 6 , tabled by Mrs Marinucci , is new and explains what is , in the Commission 's opinion , a quite essential point .
So I can say that the Commission accepts the principle of the amendment but will in due course give it a suitable form .
Mr President , I shall urge the Council to look again at the aspects raised by the amendments in the hope that it will accept this in principle , if necessary with certain adjustments in drafting .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
( The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m. )
Extraordinary Council meeting of 3 / 4 June 1996
But I would first like to mention the approach taken by the Agriculture Council in its discussions since the British government laid the official information on BSE before it last March .
The Council has expressed its determination to take all necessary measures to ensure the protection of public health .
A report on the Commission 's last inspection mission to the United Kingdom , conducted from 28 to 31 May , was presented to the Council on Monday 3 June .
The Council decided that all the new documents received should be thoroughly examined by the relevant Community departments .
Essentially this involved permitting exports of three by-products : gelatine , tallow and bull semen .
This proposal reached the Council after the Standing Veterinary Committee failed to provide an opinion on 20 May .
On the basis of the current rules of procedure , the Council could then approve the proposal from the Commission by qualified majority , amend it unanimously or reject it by simple majority .
In fact this is the criterion underlying the Commission 's whole approach to lifting the ban progressively , only as and when the scientific evidence justifies it .
You will be aware that the Commission adopted the proposed measures yesterday and they will come into force as from next Monday , 10 June .
The United Kingdom has a very detailed framework programme for the eradication of the disease and is seeking a commitment from the European partners to examine and approve it quickly .
The Italian presidency recommended thorough examination of the document by the European Commission and the appropriate Community scientific and technical bodies .
The President-in-Office of the Council and Commission President Santer have stressed in an official letter to Prime Minister Major that there is no justification for such behaviour .
We also confirmed this yesterday evening to the British Foreign and Agriculture Ministers .
Encouraging signals are now being received from the British government and we look forward to definite confirmation .
Given the urgency the Council decided to ask the European Parliament for an opinion on this proposal in the next session of 17-21 June .
We must all work together to send a message of confidence to the world of the producers and to the consumers .
In particular , I should like to report on the events that have taken place in the last few days and over the past week .
The Commission , as you know , took a decision yesterday about gelatine , tallow and bulls ' semen .
In taking that decision , the Commission was fulfilling its responsibility to take steps that will help to normalize the situation in the European Union .
However , as the President of the Commission , Jacques Santer , explained to the House yesterday , the British policy of obstruction is making the work of the Commission increasingly difficult .
Before dealing with the substance of yesterday 's decision , I should like to report briefly on the other developments , one at a time .
One thing that seems important to me is that last week from 28 to 31 May the second inspection took place in the United Kingdom .
The main purpose of the inspection was to check on the implementation of the programme for cattle older than thirty months , cattle which must not enter into the human or animal food chain .
The programme for the slaughter and disposal of animals over the age of 30 months is now fully operative .
By the end of May , around 80 000 animals had been slaughtered under that programme .
The programme presents an enormous challenge to all concerned , and especially to the authorities .
There are still problems , however , with regard to individual aspects , such as coordination problems relating to certain bodies involved in the programme and problems with the settlement of compensation claims .
The products therefore have to be kept in storage until they are finally incinerated .
I therefore believe that an organizational streamlining of the programme is desirable and would help the UK authorities to solve the present verification problems .
The United Kingdom has also now been making great efforts to enforce the feed ban .
Two sets of talks were also held last week , one with representatives of the Portuguese authorities and the other with representatives of the British authorities about their respective slaughter programmes .
At the end of last week , the United Kingdom presented the Commission authorities with the draft of a very comprehensive slaughter programme comprising just over 120 pages as well as an extensive technical annex .
This programme was also distributed to the Member States through the Council .
The programme will now need to be discussed and examined in detail , and that will also be done by the Standing Veterinary Committee today .
The opinions of the Member States on this programme are expected to be delivered at that meeting , and I hope that we shall be able to make appropriate progress today in this area too .
But let me now deal briefly with the three products to which I referred at the start , namely gelatine , tallow and bulls ' semen .
As you know , back in early April the Council adopted conclusions in which it asked the Commission to have its scientific committees examine the list of products covered by the export ban .
This was done at various meetings held by a highly diverse group of committees in the course of April .
The scientists there reached the conclusion that bulls ' semen posed no danger and should therefore be removed from the list of banned products .
In its conclusions at the end of April , the Council then asked the Commission to submit a proposal for a set of rules covering the aforementioned products in line with these scientific findings .
The Commission responded to this request and on 15 May presented the Standing Veterinary Committee with a draft opinion .
This was discussed in detail , but the Veterinary Committee has yet to deliver its opinion .
This meant that the procedure was to be continued , which was done yesterday .
Let me explain briefly the ins and outs of this decision .
It is not the case that the export ban on these products expires on Monday , so to speak . With regard to bulls ' semen , we have no objections on the basis of the scientists ' opinion .
For that reason , bulls ' semen can once more be sold within the European Union .
As for gelatine and tallow , in our Regulation we have defined a safe process by which these products must be manufactured in future .
It is also necessary , however , that companies which intend to produce gelatine or tallow obtain a licence .
This licence will be issued by the British Government .
Only when the production process has passed this inspection will the Commission give the go-ahead for the marketing of the product in question .
( Applause )
What is to be done ?
But we cannot give in to that , we must make the right signals .
Now , was yesterday 's decision by the Commission on the partial lifting of the ban right ?
It opens a window of opportunity , breaches the solid wall which would not serve the citizen well because it suggests ulterior motives .
I know there is strong anti-British feeling in the countryside , but isolating the United Kingdom is no way to handle this crisis . The problem is a collective one .
Lifting the ban , by whatever means , will not restore consumer confidence .
The more the table is thumped , the more obvious it is that there are no other arguments on the table .
All this can be done . It is reasonable , and shows political sense which is also common sense .
But if political situations can be created for purposes of domestic political window-dressing , Europe will be in a permanent state of gelatine .
Many will say that the plan of action to exclude from the human food chain all parts of bovine carcasses which could convey infection , if it were transmissible to man , should have started five years ago .
Well it did , because all ruminant material which could convey BSE to cattle was excluded six years ago .
All cattle suffering from BSE have been slaughtered to date .
That is 190 , 000 of them since 1992 , costing ECU 180m .
A further ECU 63m has been spent on research and administrative controls have cost a further ECU 43m .
The budget for research in the United Kingdom has been increased and the meat hygiene service budget also increased by £ 39m for additional control .
These measures have had a clear impact ; the number of confirmed cases has dropped since 1992 from 36 , 000 to 8 , 000 and it is still declining .
I invite everyone to read and consider the further action programme , all 121 pages of it , and to consider what has happened .
Since 29 March , 81 , 648 cattle have been slaughtered under the Government 's scheme of carcass disposal .
Last week , the total slaughter exceeded 25 , 000 and that includes the cold storage and 1 , 500 further emergencies .
In addition , 20 , 000 calves have been slaughtered since 29 March , 4 , 000 a week .
We are very grateful to the Commission for the compensation and the added intervention and support measures which I hope have been agreed .
Mr President , we understand that Lord Plumb has to put a good face on a terrible story ; we feel for him .
Mr President , I presented the truth .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , these first speeches could actually make us feel moderately optimistic .
But the fear is too great for us to surrender right away and lower our guard immediately .
This is no time to get carried away by optimism .
Personally - but I think my group will feel the same as me - I am puzzled about the partial lifting of the ban on gelatine , tallow and bull semen .
Lord Plumb will forgive me , but I am a little sceptical about the guarantees the British government is offering on the licences for these exports .
If these licences are presented , I would ask the Commissioner to supervise the situation very carefully .
The events of the last few days , the opposition and obstruction Minister Pinto has condemned , are a clear expression of the attitude the British intend to bring to this matter .
The problem is very complex and involves scientific , agricultural , economic , psychological , political , institutional aspects .
The way the situation has developed through the relationships between various institutions is not very clear , not very transparent , not very convincing .
So how and what do we decide ?
Solidarity with those affected , yes , but consumer protection and public health must come first .
Commissioner Fischler has talked about this and given assurances .
Now I want to ask him if there are sufficient resources to guarantee this action .
We hope so !
Then there are the economic measures .
ECU 650 million is not very much : a lot of people have said so and I agree .
It would make matters worse if it were badly distributed .
And there is some concern in countries like Italy , Spain , Greece and Portugal which are net importers of calves .
Mr President , the embargo on British meat and derived products has achieved three things .
It has protected the Union 's reputation for the quality of its food .
It has kept the internal market intact by preventing individual countries from erecting national barriers .
And it has obliged the United Kingdom to adopt a number of measures at last .
But it will still take some time before consumers ' confidence is restored outside the United Kingdom .
Even if the ban were completed lifted , most people would still not be ready to eat British meat .
Now that the Commission has decided partially to lift the embargo I call upon the Commission to make sure that no Member State independently introduces new import barriers .
Let the Commission also ensure that similar safety standards are applied in the whole European Union .
But , Mr President , I want above all to speak of the political background to this crisis .
The British ship of State is a rudderless vessel which has run aground on rocks of its own making .
There is a bitter irony behind the many inconsistencies in the British position .
But , Mr President , above all I should like to express today my deep concern at the emergence of a venomous nationalism in the United Kingdom .
There is mention of a wave of insults against Germany and German citizens .
That wave fills me as a citizen of the Netherlands and as a European with disappointment and shame .
How easy it is , 50 years after the Second World War to summon up a xenophobic storm and to wallow in chauvinism .
How easy it is to call up once more the demons of intolerance and prejudice which have so often disfigured European civilization .
( Applause ) How easy it is , ladies and gentlemen , for a government to encourage nationalism instead of resisting it .
There is no honour in that strategy , ladies and gentlemen .
Each of us , as politicians is faced with a choice .
We can exploit prejudices or we can help to spread tolerance .
We can excuse prejudices or we can oppose them .
We can preach nationalism or we can strengthen the rule of law within the European Union .
The conservative party has made its choice .
That party has chosen nationalism as its electoral strategy .
The conservative party is no longer the party of responsible government and of one nation .
The conservative party has become the English national party .
( Applause ) Some courageous individuals such as Emma Nicholson , have made their choice .
They have left the conservative party to join the only British party which consistently follows a pro-European line .
It is time for those of her colleagues who share her concern to follow her example .
By letting party interests prevail over the country 's interests the conservative party has shown clearly where it stands .
It is time for my conservative friends in the European Parliament to do the same .
Let them put principle above party .
Let them choose an England in the heart of Europe .
Let them choose the only British party which is not ambivalent about Europe .
Let them join the British and European liberals .
It is time to make their choice .
( Applause )
Mr President , perhaps there is no need for me to mention the wrong approach taken by the British Government but you will perhaps allow me an observation on the functioning in this case of the Community institutions .
The underlying problem with BSE is that political decisions have been subordinated to economic pressures in the United Kingdom .
The disease originated with the introduction of meal of animal origin into animal feed and a change in the industrial processes to which it was subjected .
But if blocking the Community institutions does not count as political pressure I cannot imagine what does .
The Commission claims to have scientific evidence in this connection , but it is not publishing it or passing an appropriate opinion on to the relevant scientific bodies .
There are surprising arguments in the media .
I cannot understand what the fact that the disease is not transmitted through the genes has to do with gelatine or tallow .
We also hear about the report provided by an association of gelatine makers on the safety of those products .
However , in the Commission 's earlier decisions it was stated that in the present state of knowledge there were no known processes which could fully guarantee to render the infective agent inactive .
It must be made clear that decisions are based on rigorously scientific grounds so that it may not be thought that economic interests and political pressures are taking precedence over protection of the public health .
The line taken in the CAP has led to certain problems .
The quest for competitiveness at any price encourages the introduction of methods and techniques whose long-term consequences are unknown .
The CAP was set up at the beginning of the 60s to guarantee Europe 's food supply .
Mr President , there is no anti-British climate , either in the House or in our group .
There is , however , a British Government which is irresponsibly banking on political and administrative pressure and creating an atmosphere in which nationalist chauvinism can rear its head again , which we should scarcely have thought possible .
And there is a British Government which , by means of this political and administrative pressure , is preventing the necessary measures in the United Kingdom that could lead to effective suppression of this disease .
Mr Fischler , this morning you have again been speaking of ' could ' , ' should ' and ' ought to ' with reference to the measures that the British Government must introduce .
You do not tell us what the British Government has done , because it has to be assumed that , apart from exerting political pressure , it has not done very much .
It is true that the suppression of BSE cannot be restricted to the export ban alone .
It is a European problem , as we have always said , not an English disease , so we all have responsibility to bear .
But at a time when political pressure is being applied , a decision to relax restrictions sends the wrong signal and has nothing to do with scientific findings or responsible behaviour !
And how you want to explain the lifting of the ban on bulls ' sperm , when it is perfectly clear that the disease is transmissible from one generation to the next , is beyond me .
I believe it is time to return to an objective discussion focused on BSE and to explore seriously every possible scientific avenue .
Our group originally wanted to approve this joint resolution .
We assumed that the Commission had not yet reached its final decision .
We enquired about the scientific findings in order to substantiate our decision .
But now you have crossed the Rubicon .
The die is cast .
That is why our group can no longer subscribe to this resolution .
We retract our signature .
We are opposed to a relaxation at this point in time and on the basis of the available findings .
Mr President , I am glad this debate is taking place now .
As you know , our group and the Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Group wished it to take place during the last part-session .
It is certainly not before time .
This is a crisis which affects the whole of Europe .
Of that there should be no doubt whatsoever .
It is even more galling when we think that this was supposed to be the great year of advance for Europe .
With the intergovernmental conference we were going to try to bring Europe closer together .
So you find the hapless UK Minister for Overseas Development having to veto aid to Rwanda which she believes in .
What a position for any government to put its own Ministers in !
I say to the UK Government that enough is enough is enough !
We have had the partial lifting of the ban which I welcome .
I was glad to hear Commissioner Fischler 's statement .
It is time now for the UK to say this phase is over .
They must re-think very seriously .
Die Bild-Zeitung reproduced an article from The Sun which gave its readers twenty ways to annoy the Germans , would you believe !
One of them was to burn the German flag and to send the ashes to Chancellor Kohl .
I say to the House that the UK Government has unleashed a tiger .
It will regret this and all of us in this House certainly deplore these activities .
There is , however , some good news .
That is the verdict of the Scottish voters on this anti-European hysteria which has been whipped up by the Conservative Government .
The Scottish farmers are very worried .
I spoke to one this morning who said they had given up hope .
He said the crisis was supposed to be about helping the beef farmers - the Aberdeen Angus area which I represent - and they were getting absolutely nothing .
Some farmers have benefited but some have lost business and received no compensation .
The beef farmers are asking where the action is to follow the rhetoric .
They are not at all impressed by what they have heard from Michael Forsyth , the Secretary of State for Scotland who controls the Scottish Agriculture Minister .
I trust that he will be sufficiently touched by and sensitive to our legitimate questions not to confirm that decision on 10 June , whatever the political consequences may be .
To err is human , but to persist in error is another matter .
Mr Santer also told us that his only regret was that it had been necessary to wait six weeks in order to find a solution , alibi , compromise .
Six weeks to make sure that the experts were infallible .
Six weeks to make sure that the gates of paradise were open to all , to take an economic decision against the interests of nature .
Commissioner , do you think that is reasonable ?
If your heart fails to rule your head today , fear will soon do so .
While we wait for that inevitable day , for which you will accept responsibility , let us stop expecting the worst and start hoping for the best .
Morale will benefit , and so will our health .
Commissioner , can you conscientiously take the consumer hostage now that he is refusing to consume high-risk products , having felt they represented a danger to his health ?
You are well aware that this aid will be criticized by observers of the European Union 's agricultural financing .
We will not escape that criticism , and that goes for Parliament too .
And , as always , the farmers will be in dock .
All that remains will be to dream up a system of compensation between production operations to make quite sure that farmers are divided on the subject .
Everyone will lose out : the tax-payer through the State , the farmers through their professional solidarity , and the administrative machinery as far as its operation is concerned .
That is why my group opposes the lifting of the embargo and , consequently , will vote in favour of the resolution , provided it is amended .
Mr President , the lifting of the export ban on beef derivatives is a significant step forward .
Equally , I am pleased that the British Government is at least showing some signs of constructive behaviour by apparently supporting the association agreement with Slovenia .
That slightly modified stance needs to be taken much further .
The saddest aspect of this whole business is the way the British Government has encouraged an unprecedented xenophobic , jingoistic rhetoric and practice .
Surely such language has absolutely no place in the European Union or in any civilized society .
The use of racist language and innuendo is a political tactic which will have a lasting and detrimental effect on both Britain and the European Union .
It must be our task as democrats and as parliamentarians to do all we can to end this crisis .
It must be our task to ensure that the ban is lifted .
It must be our task to help ensure that consumer confidence is restored as quickly as possible and to ensure that , above all else , jingoism is never , ever , heard again in the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the cattle disease BSE has not only provoked a crisis within the European Union ; above all , it has led to a significant loss of consumer confidence .
Anxious consumers mean a reduction in sales , and that in turn means lower prices for beef producers .
We are locked into a cycle here which has already produced unforeseeable effects and which we urgently need to bring under control .
But the best way for us to do that would be to restore confidence in European meat production .
We should therefore take a first step towards that goal by rigorously culling the BSE-infected herds .
Consumers must ultimately be able to find out where their meat comes from .
The danger at the present time is that hasty measures will be taken through force of circumstances and will sap consumer confidence still further .
In addition , continuous monitoring by the EU will be necessary in future .
This is also the context in which the Austrian position in the Council should be seen , for at the present time we feel that the uncertainties are still too great .
It is in the interests of no-one to maintain an indefinite export ban on British cattle , but it is surely in the interests of everyone that safety and quality of supply should be ensured .
Let us not only regard the current problems as a disaster but let us also see them as an opportunity to take the proper steps in the right direction .
Mr President , I wish to restate here this morning my confidence in Commissioner Fischler 's handling of the BSE crisis .
I welcome the partial lifting of the ban .
The decision is based on scientific evidence and will bring some movement in the beef sector which is very welcome at this time .
However , I urge the Commission to bring to fruition the compensation package promised to beef producers .
I also restate my view that the compensation proposed is totally inadequate and must be immediately increased .
Beef producers were already facing heavy financial losses before the BSE crisis .
I regret that the overall impact of the crisis on consumers and farmers is not improving .
The latest statement , for example , by a British scientist that the disease is transmitted by cows to their unborn calves is creating further doubts in the minds of consumers .
Where is it all going to end ?
There are people out there with all kind of agendas and nobody knows exactly where the truth lies .
We need urgently to concentrate on the public health considerations and what the position is there .
My understanding is that there is no proven health risk and surely it must be possible to have a factual and credible statement with regard to this .
In the meantime Britain continues to treat the Community with arrogance and contempt .
It created this problem and Europe is now having to pay the price .
If consumer confidence is to be restored , Britain must implement an eradication programme that will leave no doubts in the minds of consumers .
That is what the European Community is committed to funding and it is not unreasonable to expect a satisfactory response .
Let me justify that assertion .
If I say that it is too soon for the ban on these three products to be lifted , I am not denying that there may be conditions under which a very high level of safety can be guaranteed .
But the fact remains that the conditions for lifting the ban at the present juncture have not yet been fulfilled .
But the mechanism has been thrown out of balance .
Success has not yet been achieved , nor can we be certain that the three products are absolutely safe .
That is why the ban on these products has been lifted too soon !
The Commission should know that it has , to some extent , been left holding the baby .
The Commission should know that .
I believe we have really reached the point at which the BSE crisis may become a crisis in the European Union .
The British Government has to take a considerable share of the blame - of that there is no doubt - but the actions of the Commission and of some Council members are fomenting this process .
Where health is concerned there can be no half measures !
That is the foremost precept of the European Union and surely also of the British Government .
Health is paramount .
Nothing , but nothing , is anywhere near health in the list of priorities - just health , health and health again !
Only then , well down the list , come national sentiments and national sensitivities .
That applies to the continent as well as to the British Isles !
My fear is that the Council and the Commission are frittering away the trust of European people in the European Union , and Parliament should have no part in this squalid process !
Mr President , the BSE crisis is now ten weeks ' old .
It is the fruit of a reckless statement to the House of Commons which had no scientific basis .
Since then the European beef industry has been brought to its knees .
Farmers , especially those in major exporting areas such as Ireland , have suffered tremendous losses .
Many are now close to bankruptcy .
Consumer confidence in beef has been severely undermined and consumption levels have declined by anything up to 30 % .
We now need immediate and well-focused action to restore consumer confidence and eradicate the BSE disease .
In the last few days , following many meetings , including briefings from UK ministers , we have seen some positive developments .
The British Government now assures us that the rules on the disposal of offal and contaminated feed have been strengthened , are being rigorously enforced and are now watertight .
At last the British Government has produced a fairly detailed programme for the eradication of BSE .
Although this document is far from perfect it is going in the right direction .
In addition the Commission has produced a new programme to compensate farmers for some of their losses .
There are , however , some negative developments .
The British decision to disrupt Community business is wrong .
It is counterproductive and it has made a bad situation very much worse .
It is bad for Britain , bad for Europe and will only prolong the crisis .
This display of lawlessness at the highest level of government is unacceptable in a Union based on the rule of law and solidarity .
This is a lesson in how not to resolve conflict within the EU .
In areas such as Ireland farming incomes have been decimated through no fault of the farmers concerned .
The British Government has failed since 1989 to recognize the gravity of the situation .
We are now reaping the harvest of its inaction .
It must now sit down with the Commission and examine the eradication programme and adopt a set of measures to eradicate BSE and restore consumer confidence .
Consumers must once again be convinced that beef is a wholesome food .
The current diet of misinformation and distorted facts must cease .
Finally , the Commission must urgently re-examine the proposed compensation package for beef farmers .
Any help is welcome but the current package will have to be substantially increased if it is to address the real losses to the people involved .
Mr President , Lord Plumb is an able advocate - nobody denies that .
He told us movingly about the work going on in the UK to deal with BSE .
Sadly he omitted to tell us how the mess was caused in the first place .
He did not tell us who was responsible , who had been reckless with consumer interests and who had been reckless with the health interests of the population in the last fifteen years .
However , not even Lord Plumb 's advocacy - Mr de Vries will be very happy to hear this - can save the British Conservative Party from their own fate at the hands of the political equivalent of BSE .
Only a programme of electoral culling can do that .
It is more than two and a half months since the British Minister told the House of Commons of the possible link between BSE and CJD .
Ten weeks later it is only this week that we have received a plan to deal with the problem .
Now we have two ministers touring the capitals on what they call a charm offensive .
They do not include Lord Plumb because he is far too committed a European for that .
But two ministers - I am not sure , incidentally , which one is charm and which one is offensive - are touring the European capitals .
It is a bit like sending Saddam Hussein on a peace mission .
In this Parliament we need to reorientate the debate to concentrate on public health , to recognize that there are still mysteries surrounding this disease .
We do not know about transmissibility and we do not really know about its origins .
Far too much of this debate and far too many of these concerns have been hidden behind a shroud of secrecy in the Council and elsewhere .
As a consequence of that hearing , the European Parliament adopted a resolution on 12 March 1991 urging the British Government to ban human and animal consumption of beef from herds suspected of carrying BSE .
In the years that followed Parliament adopted further resolutions .
There was virtually no response from the British Government .
Carelessness and ignorance have prevented resolute and timely action to eliminate the disease .
In this way the British Government has put its own farmers and its own consumers in a critical economic situation as well as endangering their health .
This situation has now affected the whole of Europe .
Farmers and consumers are deeply disappointed at the ineptitude of the British administration !
( Applause ) The protection of health takes priority over the lifting of the export ban , as Mr Santer said yesterday .
The decision to buy a product is taken by the consumer .
The consumer wants to know where gelatine and tallow , as products or as ingredients in other products , come from and whether they are harmless .
I ' m telling you that straight !
Only when it was officially established that the disease had been eradicated was the export ban lifted in both countries .
Only then could free trading be resumed .
Mr President , I think the attitude of the United Kingdom on this question is not only regrettable but fundamentally reprehensible .
In a community based on the rule of law such as the European Union it seems that there can be no justification for pressurization and such blocking tactics as we have seen .
It therefore seems to us essential that the Commission should place all the information available before the European Parliament and before public opinion .
We also need close Commission monitoring of the measures taken by the United Kingdom .
We think it is important that the Commission , after examining the United Kingdom 's measures , should see that they are strictly complied with so that they may be effective .
Only that will really help to restore consumers ' confidence .
It seems to us that such changes do not help to restore consumers ' confidence either .
Finally I should like to put a specific question to the Commissioner : has the resignation of a highly-placed Spanish official in the Directorate General for Agriculture anything to do with this matter ?
Here the Union 's solidarity in the face of this serious crisis is demonstrated .
One Member was saying that in a similar matter - African horse sickness - her country was left to cope alone , and that should not be the position either .
The ban is to be lifted on trade in gelatine , tallow and semen .
As regards the first two - gelatine and tallow - we are speaking of cosmetics , food , soft drinks , chocolates , sweets , sausages , doughnuts and so on .
It seems , according to what the Commissioner has just said , that technically control by sterilization methods is guaranteed .
But I have my doubts about semen since the measures we have heard about , such as sterilization , as the word indicates , would leave it useless .
Commissioner , the health of consumers is the first consideration .
We must not play with these things .
We must control the problem we are speaking of and above all follow things up in the country of origin to prevent possible escalation of the problem at Union level .
Mr President , in everyday life if not in European politics the penalty for blackmail is imprisonment .
So no-one must be surprised if it acquires a taste for that and continues with its policy of blackmail .
Now it has already announced that it will continue blocking all European decisions until there is also an agreement on total abolition of the export ban on British meat .
The extent of the present crisis is clearly the product of thoughtless deregulation and maladministration on the part of the British Government .
Why has no publicity ever been given to that import ban , Commissioner Fischler ?
Why has that never been contested as import bans are normally contested ?
Mr President , I would like colleagues to focus on what we do now and next week .
This is an appalling problem , it can be solved and the resolution of it lies in our own hands .
We now have an eradication plan on the table and the derivatives ban has been lifted , courtesy of the courage and persistence of Commissioner Fischler .
Yesterday , President Santer asked for a de-escalation of the British policy of non-cooperation with Europe .
Last night he got it from the British Foreign Secretary in Rome , announcing that we would not veto the association with Slovenia .
What we need to do now is concentrate on establishing a framework for the progressive lifting of the main ban .
The British Government is not asking for dates , it is not asking for anything to be taken on trust ; it is asking merely for the establishment of a framework .
That can and should be delivered .
It would be easier for it to be delivered if people abandoned some of the rhetorical tricks they have been using this morning .
This is not clever , what we need is a resolution of this problem and that means an early negotiation of a framework .
I would like to say to my friend Mr de Vries that you are right to raise the demon of nationalism , but this is ' pitch ' and you must be careful how you throw it around .
It sticks and plays precisely to the nationalist demon that lurks in all countries and in all parties .
Mr President , I am sure you will join me in thanking the Commission for their continued effort towards finding a solution to the on-going crisis in the beef industry .
Only through dialogue will solutions be found which are satisfactory to all those who , through no fault of their own , have become involved .
For that reason I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Collins who has pointed out that a number of questions remain unanswered .
For example , questions about epidemiology and transmissibility .
Not only must we also establish an information programme for consumers but the means should be made available to answer the questions that need to be answered before consumer confidence is restored .
The final point I would like to make is one which I have made before and will continue to make .
Whilst I welcome the aid package which has been proposed by the Commission , assistance has only been extended to farmers and the slaughter industry .
The plight of others is being ignored .
To date , 36 , 000 people in the United Kingdom , employed in the beef industry , have lost their jobs and many others are likely to do so .
Some of those people are with us today in the visitors ' gallery .
The United Kingdom recently handed back ECU 200m , which was earmarked for the agricultural processing industry , to the Commission .
I call upon the United Kingdom Government to spend that money for the purpose it was intended ; to help those employed in rural industry .
I urge the Commission and Parliament to ensure that they do so .
Our task is to bring an end to the crisis for all those affected and not , as the British Government seem to be doing , continue down paths which deepen rather than solve problems .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to deal very briefly with some of the interventions we have heard , because I think it is important to spell out the basis of the Commission 's deliberations .
Moreover , I believe the situation is serious enough without the addition of any distorted representations , which I should like to dispel .
With regard to bulls ' semen , I was asked where there had been a scientific decision or recommendation on this matter .
Well , the Scientific Veterinary Committee adopted several conclusions at its meeting on 26 April .
The first of these reads as follows : ' The committee concludes therefore that semen does not present a risk of transmission of BSE ' .
I believe that this constitutes a clear recommendation , and we have acted upon it .
And by the way , Mr Funk , we too are shrewd enough to work out that we cannot sterilize bulls ' semen if it is to achieve its intended purpose !
( Laughter , applause ) And so to gelatine and tallow .
What we decided upon begins with the definition of a process , as I explained earlier , and goes on to define a procedure .
In other words , the date from which tallow and gelatine may actually be exported again has not even been set .
I therefore marvel at all those who already know that the ban is being lifted too soon .
I believe we must remain consistent and logical here , otherwise we run the risk of not being taken seriously .
I was also asked how further controls will be organized once the first checks have taken place .
One thing is already clear to all of us in the Commission : the health and safety of consumers must be the supreme imperative .
These intervention measures , of course , primarily help the processing industry ; they also help the abattoirs and those who work there .
Fifty thousand tonnes of intervention stocks cost ECU 120 million .
In April and May alone we bought up 115 000 tonnes of intervention stocks and have just put a further intervention of 50 000 tonnes out to tender .
All of these measures added together naturally produce a considerably higher amount , more than double the 650 million debated here .
I should also like to add that we have three more projects in the pipeline .
But one thing is clear .
We must surmount these acute difficulties now .
The debate is closed .
I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m .
Financial services and movement of natural persons
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this report outlines the results of the WTO negotiations on financial services and on movement of natural persons in the framework of the multilateral trading system .
The GATT Agreement signed in 1994 by 76 contracting parties had hitherto applied only to trade in goods and has now been supplemented by a General Agreement on Trade in Services ( GATS ) .
In December 1994 the European Parliament gave its assent to the results of the Uruguay Round .
GATS is an integral part of the legal framework of the multilateral trading system .
It covers the entire range of services , including financial services .
As is the case with trade in goods , the basic principles are those of most-favoured-nation treatment and national treatment .
It was clear from the very beginning that services markets could only be opened up in stages .
With regard to the overall content , it may be said that in many participating countries the business prospects for foreign banks have been improved .
Financial institutions and insurers can upgrade their operations , either through branches on the spot or through cross-border transactions .
The attitude of the United States remains disappointing .
Several U.S. withdrawals from various negotiations in recent times makes one wonder where U.S. trade policy is headed .
Although not all the results of these negotiations have lived up to our expectations , we can still give our assent to the results as a whole . And I do mean ' assent ' literally .
The Commission had proposed that Parliament merely be consulted on the conclusion of the negotiations , a proposal based on the first subparagraph of Article 228 ( 3 ) of the EC Treaty .
It would be illogical if assent procedure were not applied in this case .
Whoever gives assent to a procedure is also entitled to give assent to any subsequent changes in the procedure .
I believe this represents an inadmissible attempt to curtail the rights of the European Parliament .
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights , which was consulted on this report and delivered its opinion , endorses our position and also pleads the case for assent procedure .
We are grateful to the draftsman , Mrs Schaffner , for her report .
I should like to conclude by making a few remarks on the timescale within which the European Parliament has had to deal with this matter .
The negotiations were completed at the end of last July .
The results are to enter into force no later than 30 July of this year .
Following the end of negotiations it took nine months for the Commission proposal to be tabled and a total of ten months before it was referred to Parliament .
How can a proper balanced process of parliamentary deliberation be implemented under these circumstances ?
The fact that we have managed to do this and to subject the proposal to serious examination is due to the speed at which the Committee on External Economic Relations has been working .
I should like to thank all of my fellow Members for helping to put this through so quickly .
I ask the House to approve this report .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in this case , as so often these days , we have good news and bad news .
The good news is that the proposal was referred to Parliament and the committee at all .
Our thanks go to the Commission for that .
The first reason is that it is the extension of a treaty - GATT - to which we had to give our assent .
It is the logical sequel and the logical consequence of this that all further negotiations resulting from the treaty should be subject to parliamentary assent as a matter of course .
The second reason is that GATS is an international agreement , and international agreements are now referred to us .
I simply ask the Commission and the Council to take note of that and to let Parliament perform the duty which is incumbent upon us and which we are prepared to discharge in a responsible manner .
There is another piece of good news , thanks once again to the Commission .
This is the second time I have thanked you today , because you have really done some excellent work .
You undoubtedly prevented the collapse of the talks during the negotiating rounds .
We know how difficult the Americans were as negotiating partners , in the talks on the telecommunications element of GATS as in other domains .
Here too , you negotiated exceedingly well , for which I offer you our special thanks .
This should send a signal to the United States , urging it simply to regard liberalization as a philosophy that should be followed throughout the world .
The United States has almost always been the leading exponent of free trade , but now it is abandoning the principle wherever awkward situations arise , and that must not happen !
The Americans really must see the process through and stop merely pushing national and regional interests .
That also applies , incidentally , to our debate on Helms-Burton .
I ask the United States to take this message to heart .
Mr President , I rise with mixed feelings to speak in this debate as regards both the procedure and the substance .
We naturally welcome the fact that the Council has consulted Parliament on the agreement negotiated in the framework of the World Trade Organization .
But we are disappointed that the Council has preferred the consultation procedure to the assent procedure .
We are also disappointed that once again the Council is allowing Parliament such a short time for giving its views .
That is becoming a habit .
It has taken some ten months for the Council to consult Parliament .
Now Parliament has very few weeks if the date on which the agreement takes effect is to be observed .
As regards the substance I shall be very brief .
I refer to our colleague Mr Kittelmann 's excellent report .
But I should like to express the hope that the concessions in opening up the markets will increase the commercial opportunities for banks , financial institutions and insurance companies .
It is a pity that the United States has felt unable to take part in the agreement .
That will not perhaps have any dramatic effects as regards our relations with the United States , but it undeniably reduces the credibility of the World Trade Organization .
In conclusion I should like to say this : Parliament must be consulted according to the assent procedure whenever agreements concerning the World Trade Organization are involved .
That is moreover the view of the Committee on Legal Affairs too .
We may therefore hope that Parliament will accept Mr Kittelman 's two amendments contained in his report .
Finally one last observation .
Parliament must protect its institutional position not only within the European Union but also within the World Trade Organization .
I think Parliament must therefore do everything necessary in order to be represented by a delegation at the ministerial conference in Singapore in December next .
It would be inconceivable if Parliament were unable to attend .
We know that it had been a bone of contention for years .
We know that many developing countries had very serious objections to this agreement and to one-sided liberalization of trade in services in general .
Among their objections was the fact that , although the agreement was intended to create freedom of movement for major banks and insurance companies , it contained no provisions on the free movement of persons .
A concession has since been made to the developing countries , but this does not alter the fundamental issue .
We also know that the United States has not acceded to this agreement , so a major international trading nation is missing .
What we do not know , however , is how this agreement will affect employment in Europe and in the Third World .
The WTO is conducting secret diplomacy , and the European Commission seems bent on outdoing it for secrecy .
Not even the competent parliamentary committee was duly informed .
Two years ago we were already sounding warnings to the effect that the WTO would mean less democratic control by parliaments and citizens .
To rush through in this way , without time for careful scrutiny , an agreement with such far-reaching implications for people 's lives cannot be justified to the voters who gave us our parliamentary mandates .
That is why we shall not vote for this agreement .
Nor can I share the euphoria about the liberalization of world trade that is prevalent in parts of this House .
On the contrary , I fear that if we continue to pursue this ambition we shall liberalize ourselves to death .
Mr President , the liberalization of services would be a significant step towards the worldwide liberalization of trade if the United States did not refuse to approve it .
The agreement that was achieved certainly offers easier access to new markets for European businesses .
That will have some beneficial effects , especially in the fast-growing markets of the developing and newly developed countries .
However , without the approval of the United States , which leads the field in international competition , the liberalization of service markets has been severely disrupted , to put it mildly .
When this decision is implemented , great care will also have to be taken to abide by the principles of mostfavoured nation treatment and national treatment .
Otherwise the agreement could very quickly turn out to be an exercise in self-deception .
Liberalization also presupposes scrupulous observance of the legal provisions governing the capital and liquid resources of financial service enterprises .
The point that this Council proposal would have benefited from better cooperation and above all from parliamentary assent has already been adequately expounded .
As you all know , in July 1995 , the European Community made a decisive contribution to the conclusion of these negotiations .
The excellent results obtained under the Community 's leadership have confirmed Europe 's position in the World Trade Organization , which will need to be further consolidated in the future .
The proposal for a Council decision , which confirms the commitments made by the Community , is the final step in these negotiations .
The deadline for acceptance of the legal instruments implementing our commitments is fixed for the end of this month .
As I have already said , the Council decision , proposed by the Commission , will allow the Community to confirm the results of the Geneva negotiations .
This does not apply in the present case , so Article 189b cannot be invoked .
I also want to clarify some points that were made on the connection between the conclusion of this negotiation and the results of the Uruguay Round .
The Uruguay Round package presupposes the creation of a new institutional framework with binding legal rules and disciplines .
The assent of the European Parliament was asked for on that basis .
That is how the World Trade Organization was created and is now operating .
Finally I would like to emphasize , Mr President , that the Commission has thought long and hard about the type of opinion Parliament should be asked for .
For the reasons I have just given we did not consider it appropriate to apply Article 228 ( 3 ) ( 1 ) which provides specifically for assent .
So Parliament is being asked to give its opinion on the basis of Article 228 ( 3 ) ( 1 ) .
Recent developments demonstrate that the leadership of the European Community is undeniably necessary .
Here I would also like to express my thanks for the recognition accorded to the Commission 's conduct of the negotiations .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m .
Votes
I do not say that scientology is a dangerous sect .
I have my own opinion on the matter .
Even so , I do find it a bit much for Parliament to have authorized a meeting of this kind .
Furthermore , I learned this morning that the meeting had been cancelled at the last moment .
I cannot tell you whether that meeting was really authorized or had simply been announced , but I am taking note of what you say .
That is why bilateral agreements between Morocco and the European States concerned could usefully extend these relationships into the future .
Not only that , but this agreement is incompatible with the principle of national preference , which seems to us more important than ever .
I am thinking especially of national preference in employment , at a time when millions of men and women in France , as throughout Europe , are the victims of unemployment .
That is why we voted against the von Habsburg report , which reflects a policy of which we disapprove .
This general policy only serves , in the long run , the interests of a handful of multinationals and the globalist lobby .
I did not vote for the von Habsburg report .
It is a most inappropriate time to make this agreement with Morocco .
We have sacrificed our principles of defence of human rights on the altar of trade .
We have abandoned the people of the Western Sahara for this shoddy and shabby deal on trade .
Therefore I cannot support this agreement .
It is not as if the inhumanity and the escalation of the conflict with Polisario had happened yesterday .
Efforts to find a solution have been going on for years , and it is quite obviously the case that Morocco has no interest in an amicable settlement .
Nor are the human-rights violations a new phenomenon .
I am not prepared to pay the piper before he plays the tune .
I should have considered it more appropriate to state clearly that there should and must be such an agreement but only if Morocco fulfils the clear conditions that this Parliament has stated in its resolution .
Madam President , it is because we would not wish on Morocco something we reject for ourselves that we have not voted for the association agreement with that great country .
Because , more and more , we are seeing the fateful effects for nations throughout the world of Treaties inspired by the single notion of free trade .
So let us first put our own house in order , by breaking with the single-track thinking and totalitarian methods worthy of the Brave New World , before we start giving lectures to the Kingdom of Morocco .
Parliament earlier rejected ratification of the financial protocol between the EU and Morocco precisely because of the Moroccan government 's infringements of international law .
Another major problem is Morocco 's systematic boycott of the process to implement the UN Security Council 's resolutions that a free referendum should be held concerning the independence of Western Sahara .
For this reason we will vote against the report .
And without an association agreement there will be no fisheries agreement : we cannot have the sun shining on the threshing floor and rain on the turnips ...
This House has voted in favour of the association agreement between the European Union and Morocco , and I welcome that vote .
By making this gesture we have accepted the conclusions arrived at by Mr von Habsburg , and I congratulate him on his excellent work .
We all have at heart the process of renewal of the European Union 's Mediterranean policy , established by the Barcelona Conference .
In giving our assent , we are keeping faith with the desires we expressed .
This agreement will stimulate Morocco to expedite the opening-up of its economy , with a view to a free trade area .
In addition , economic cooperation will be strengthened , with the aim of supporting and developing sectors that create jobs .
That leaves the matter of human rights , an argument of which much has been made by the supporters of a ' no ' vote .
It is my deep-seated conviction that this question should be integrated into the actual philosophy of the association agreement .
We are giving a clear political signal to the Moroccan authorities to continue along the road towards liberalization , political as well as economic .
Finally , let us also remember that the fisheries agreement has already received the assent of this House .
Not to give our assent to the association agreement would have made no sense at all .
I voted in favour of giving Parliament 's assent to the association agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco for several reasons .
This agreement is a consistent follow-up to the decisions taken at Essen in 1994 and at Cannes in 1995 by the European Summits of Heads of State and government of the European Union .
It is the third agreement of this kind signed within the framework of the Union 's Mediterranean policy , following the EU / Tunisia and EU / Israel agreements .
On the financial side , this agreement is covered until 1999 by the credits allocated within the framework of the MEDA programme .
A number of instruments have , indeed , already been established since that date .
February 1991 : limitation of the period for which people can be held in police custody or preventive detention ;
The agreement now approved has in itself some good aspects ; it will bring the people of Morocco closer to Europe and will have the effect of bringing Europe closer to the people of Morocco .
We have always been and shall always be in favour of an agreement with Morocco .
Above all , it is worth repeating , because of the way in which Europe protected ( or rather did not protect ) one of its Members .
We are sure that the Kingdom of Morocco will see the importance of the way we have voted and that the European Union will understand it .
Farassino report
We regard the design and issuing of driving licences as a matter for national governments , not only in the EU but throughout the world .
There is no need for a special EU driving licence .
The principle laid down in Article 1 of Directive 91 / 439 / EEC concerning mutual recognition of national driving licences is entirely sufficient .
In view of the above we are voting against the report .
This directive has been improved considerably since the first reading . I am therefore voting for it .
However , I regard the whole idea of an obligatory common driving licence for the different countries of the Union to be wrong .
Each country should have the right to decide for itself on the design of driving licences .
The directive will only give rise to unnecessary change-over costs in the Member States .
Adoption of the common driving licence model should at least be voluntary .
Marinucci recommendation
I want to express my support and that of the Green Group for the Marinucci report on the proposal to amend the regulation establishing LIFE .
The fact that the common position took up a large number of the amendments proposed by Parliament at first reading is a positive sign .
I hope the Commission will support the point of view of the European Parliament 's Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection .
I only wish to repeat what I said in my speech during first reading .
I have no doubt that the amendment will be accepted as the Commission told us in the previous debate .
I shall therefore vote in favour .
Parodi report
The Commission 's communication on the common transport policy action programme 1995-2000 has many serious failings from the environmental point of view .
The proposed green paper on the internalisation of external costs and citizens ' networks is a positive element , however .
The Committee on Transport and Tourism describes transport and the trans-European networks as ' the basis for social , economic and cultural development ' .
It is against this background that we abstained in the final vote on the Parodi report .
We have voted for the report and the amendments from the Greens , including paragraph 41 , integrity , Amendment No 12 by the Green Group .
I believe that the time zones which countries belong to and the summertimes they adopt are national matters where the principle of subsidiarity should apply .
A common rule on the maximum permitted blood alcohol level is desirable but I would like it to be possible for stricter national requirements to be applied , as well as a zero level for all drugs .
For the rest , I welcome the proposals concerning environmental adjustment put forward by the rapporteur .
I would stress that changing over to a transport system more suited to the environment is of the utmost importance if European industry is not to fall behind .
It is true that the European Parliament has on several occasions called , unsuccessfully , for genuine fiscal and social harmonization .
I believe the problems I have just mentioned are of quite crucial importance for safety , and indeed for the improvement of road safety .
Since Mr Parodi 's report virtually avoids this subject , I feel obliged to abstain in the vote , although certain other proposals made by Mr Parodi seem to me to be acceptable .
Plooij-Van Gorsel report
As I did not have the opportunity to speak when the report was debated in plenary I would now like to give an explanation of vote on the subject .
I believe greater emphasis should have been placed on the waste which partly accounts for the administrative costs of 13 % .
Corresponding costs in normal research programmes are between 2 % and 3 % .
Where future research programmes are concerned we must make sure that stringent measures are taken to keep down administrative costs .
In the research world it is generally acknowledged that bureaucracy and high costs are typical of EU research programmes .
This state of affairs should be properly reviewed and appropriate measures taken .
Argyros report
This report from the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy constitutes an excellent analysis of the Commission 's green paper on innovation .
Three fundamental considerations in this report should be emphasized .
Innovation involves to a very high degree the application of technology in production and the life of the community .
Pompidou report
For the same reason it is also the first time the question has been raised in the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers .
So far as choosing the form of cooperation is concerned the rapporteur discusses three possible models for cooperation , namely association , bilateral cooperation and cooperation with technological assistance .
Non-admission of Croatia to the Council of Europe
Because , after all , who would venture to claim that the press is freer in Russia - to name but one instance - than it is in Croatia ?
Croatia had to conduct a heroic struggle for its independence before reestablishing its economy .
And admittedly , we who maintain close links with the opposition know that Mr Tudjman 's present government is persisting in practices that still reflect socialist customs , which are difficult to get rid of .
A single broadcast about Aids , which seems to be regarded as the only illness worthy of sympathy , a hundred times more so than cancer or muscular dystrophy or all the other illnesses put together .
What strange exclusive criterion , what strange variety of racism treats such things as acceptable at home but criticizes them in Croatia ?
The votes of some Members may also reflect a delayed reaction to Croatian independence , which some groups accepted reluctantly .
This , however , would be the wrong way to lead a country scarred by years of Communist dictatorship and by civil war towards the Western European fold .
For that reason we reject this resolution .
Extraordinary Council meeting
At first sight this may seem a difficult line to follow , but if we fail to follow it for the sake of simplicity we risk regretting it bitterly in a few years ' time .
So let us act responsibly .
And acting responsibly includes analysing the underlying causes of the crisis and implementing the essential remedies to ensure that it does not recur elsewhere .
First , let us acknowledge that mad cow disease is the result of unnatural agricultural practices , embarked upon in a mad race for world market prices .
This deplorable approach is now engraved on the heart of the new common agricultural policy .
Unless we undertake a radical change in direction , we must be prepared for other mad cows , or worse , in future years .
After all , it is quite possible that the chaotic state of frontier controls has facilitated the fraudulent importing of contaminated meat or cattle feeds into mainland Europe .
We must accept that States have the right to control their frontiers for the objectives stated in Article 36 of the Treaty , in particular the protection of human life and health .
That , they will tell us , is what the Treaties say .
Well , our answer to that is that the Treaties are absurd .
This abdication of responsibility by the politicians in favour of civil servants dishonours the Council and helps to explain much of what is wrong in Europe .
Madam President , in my view the British Government is making itself look very silly in the present circumstances .
However , I regret that today 's resolution was a very substantial change from the resolution we passed on 28 March .
Now we seem to be supporting the ban rather than being an interested , neutral observer .
I would rather we have maintained the position whereby we were an observer of the ban rather than a supporter of the ban .
A few nights ago I was in my hotel room watching German television .
I found some of the scenes quite distressing and quite offensive .
I have been very critical of the way the British press has been talking about our partners in Europe in recent weeks .
I would ask that the continental media show some balance in the way in which they report the subject of BSE .
One British factory , the Dunkester factory in Yorkshire , by changing its manufacturing processes , has poisoned 156 , 000 British cattle to date , and a few others elsewhere in the world .
Well , that is a matter of responsibility .
Every human act that causes damage to another person obliges the party responsible for the error to put things right .
I abstained on account of Recital E , which recommends additional support for agriculture of several billion .
I consider current agricultural support to be wasteful and do not wish to contribute to further subsidies for this sector .
Madam President , I voted against the resolution .
I should have expected the European Parliament to signal far more clearly that consumer protection and public health are not subordinated to economic interests in the European Union .
The decision taken by the Commission makes a mockery of consumer protection and public health .
The relaxation of the export ban at a time when more and more cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are coming to light can only lead one to conclude that such a decision is based on sheer cynicism .
The Commission , the Council and even , to an increasing extent , the European Parliament are buckling under the blackmail tactics of the British Government .
It is to be feared that the Commission 's decision will pave the way for the complete lifting of the export ban .
I believe it is a totally misguided decision , because consumer protection and public health must take priority .
We must practise preventive health care .
As long as scientists cannot rule out a health risk , we must try to have the export ban maintained .
That should have been our aim .
That concludes voting time .
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament .
( The sitting was closed at 12.10 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 6 June 1996 .
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen , in particular from the region concerned , have asked me to make a short statement on the bombing in Manchester last Saturday .
The IRA bomb injured over two hundred people , many of them seriously ; it caused vast material damage to the centre of Manchester .
It is almost a miracle that hundreds of people were not killed .
There is no possible or conceivable justification for the IRA bomb .
The targets were ordinary men , women and children shopping , on Saturday morning , in a busy city .
What possible cause could justify such barbarism ?
The European Parliament expresses its sympathy for those injured by the bomb in Manchester last Saturday , and our hopes for their speedy and full recovery .
I am writing to the Lord Mayor of Manchester to pass on this message to the injured and to their families .
I am sure that I speak for the whole House when I say that the cause of peace must not be abandoned because of intimidation by terrorists .
( Applause ) Terrorism can be defeated by the courage and steadfastness of communities and their leaders , to keep the peace process moving forward .
( Applause )
Mr President , as the Member who represents the constituency where this terrible atrocity took place , I want to thank you for the comments you have made on behalf of all the House .
I know that my constituents , as all the colleagues here , share those views .
I simply wish to add a tribute to the members of the emergency services whose prompt and professional actions saved many lives .
Without those actions there would indeed have been a terrible mass murder .
This was the largest explosion of its kind on mainland Britain since the Second World War .
We should be very thankful that , despite the efforts of the bombers , at least no-one died .
But terrible damage has been caused and we all share your condemnation of this atrocious act .
In the circumstances of the peace process there is no justification for this , or in any other circumstances for that matter .
I endorse your view that this House must support in every possible way the peace process .
I appeal to the men of violence to lay down their arms , to stop their murderous acts of violence in Ireland and elsewhere .
Again , Mr President , thank you for your statement .
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of Parliament , I wish to welcome 40 honorary consuls who have taken their seats in the official gallery .
They are members of the Federation of Consuls in Europe , which is holding its annual meeting here at the European Parliament .
You are very welcome !
