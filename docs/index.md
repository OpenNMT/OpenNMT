This portal provides an advanced documentation of the OpenNMT **Torch version**.

# Overview

OpenNMT is a generic deep learning framework mainly specialized in sequence-to-sequence models covering a variety of tasks such as [machine translation](/applications/#machine-translation), [summarization](/applications/#summarization), [image to text](/applications/#image-to-text), and [speech recognition](/applications/#speech-recognition). The framework has also been extended for other non sequence-to-sequence tasks like [language modelling](/applications/#language-modelling) and [sequence tagging](/applications/#sequence-tagging).

All these applications are reusing and sometimes extending a collection of easy-to-reuse modules: [encoders](/training/models/#encoders), [decoders](/training/models/#decoders), [embeddings layers](/training/embeddings/), [attention layers](/training/models/#attention-model), and more.

The framework is implemented to be as generic as possible and can be used either via command line applications, client-server, or libraries.
