## Machine Translation

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is the default and original task for OpenNMT. It requires a corpus of bilingual sentences as available on [Opus](http://opus.lingfil.uu.se). Training a NMT engine is a 3 steps process:

* Tokenization
* Preprocessing
* Training

Step by step process is described on the [quickstart page](/quickstart/) and full process to train large system is described on the forum [here](http://forum.opennmt.net/t/training-english-german-wmt15-nmt-engine/29).

## Summarization

Summarization models are trained exactly like NMT models - the nature of the training data is different: source corpus are full length document / articles, and target are summaries. [This forum post](http://forum.opennmt.net/t/text-summarization-on-gigaword-and-rouge-scoring/85/) details how to train and evaluation a summarization model.
